I am the EES Account Manager for Pilkington North America.  \nPilkington is a lage scale glass manufacturer with a plant in Lathrop, \nCalifornia.  They, like many other PG&E ratepayers, are going to be subjected \nto load curtailment this summer.  Being a large scale glass manufacturer who \nconsumes a great deal of energy, they feel that being subjected to a \ncurtailment would jeopardize the safety of the Lathrop community.  If the \nplant withstood a full scale meltdown in their furnace, caused by a \ncurtailment, a plant of that size would require an enormous group of \nemergency service personnel.  Such a significant presence at the facility \nwould jeopardize the safety of the rest of that small community.\n\nPilkington has already forwarded a letter to PG&E documenting this and it is \ncurrently under review.  I would like to know if you or a member of your \ngroup could pursue any political avenues with this letter.

One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to \nsell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was \nsnapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories \ngo on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of \nentrepreneurs.\n\nNot having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer \nfamiliar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular \nhistorians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a \nhistorian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone \nwhose produced work would reach a lot of people.  \n\nMaybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe \neven someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting \nhistory of Enron.\n\nBecause ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as \nthis pursued.

I enjoyed being your neighbor and already miss all of you.  \n\nHave a Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nKelly"", ""Re: trucking LNG to California - \n\nThe short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option \nfor endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a \ncouple of reasons for this. \n\nFirst, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only \ntwo plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, \naffluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military \nand industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG \nTechnologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck \nfleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I \nwas not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is \noperating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and \nTopock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern \nCalifornia and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by \nALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and \nsubsequent loading onto trucks.\n\nSecond, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The \naverage truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into \n820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could \ndeliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely \ntransfer it into storage. \n\nThe only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would \nbe a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under \nrepair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 \nmmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a \ntime - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, \nALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some \nreason. \n\nI'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. \nI think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located \npeakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. \n\nPlease let me know if you have specific questions."", ""John:\n\nI received your voice mail upon return to the office this morning.  I'm sorry the schedules did not match up yesterday but certainly hope the next opportunity to meet will not be long in coming.  I was most impressed with the quality of students interviewed on campus yesterday.  Likewise, I have now had a chance to meet some of those we have hired while I was in London.  The high standard clearly continues.  \n\nConcerning your reference to the annual finance conference, I have kept up with each event from a distance.  Memory serving, it has been about four years since the concept was first considered.  Time flies!  Others have also said that it is a real success.  Many thanks to you and others at Baylor for the time and effort dedicated to date.\n\nLet me know when you have plans to be in Houston in the future.  I'll do the same when in Waco.
