Congrats to all the happy couples!      urlLink First gay couples wed in US state  &nbsp; In the coming days, hundreds of couples are set to follow the exampleof Marcia Kadish and Tanya McCloskey of Malden, who have been togetherfor 18 years. There were jubilant scenes in the city of Cambridge, which began issuinglicences to gay and lesbian couples from midnight (0400 GMT). The issue has divided opinion and politicians across the US. On Friday, the US Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch attempt by conservativegroups to stop same-sex marriages from becoming legal in the state. In Cambridge, gay and lesbian couples queued for marriage licences outsidethe city hall - which opened as the law came into force. Newly-wed Tanya McCloskey said: 'It was really important to us to justbe married... Part of it is, we don't know what the Legislature is goingto do.' She and partner Marcia Kadish worked at breakneck pace to fill out paperwork,get a waiver from the usual three-day waiting period, then return to cityhall - where they got their marriage licence and exchanged vows. Political divisions Other towns and cities across the state were also prepared to wed largenumbers of same-sex couples as the law came into force. Some US cities have controversially allowed gay marriages The Supreme Court ruling upheld a decision by the state's highest court. It said that denying marriage licences to same-sex couples violatedanti-discrimination laws. The Massachusetts ruling has fuelled heated debate across the country- and the controversy has been particularly intense in an election year. President George W Bush has called for an amendment to the US Constitutionthat would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. His rival John Kerry - who is a Massachusetts senator - is also opposedto same-sex marriages, but favours a more limited form of legal recognition. Thousands of same-sex couples were married in San Francisco earlierthis year, but the marriages were not recognized by the state of California.

I didn't know how to answer that, so I said the first stupid thing that came to my mouth. Why? and of course she came up with some other excuse about how if we were talking the line would be busy in case someone else called. This upset me very much. I didn't know what to do. But like i said, we went to her house later and hung out. It was fun, i think she was stressed out though. I felt kinda bad cause she didn't seem to happy. It was annoying too cause all my friends were telling me to go for stuff, her parents were in the connected room over and could see everything so I wasn't going to do anything! But they kept annoying me, I didn't do anything though. I couldn't stomach it. I think Liza would get mad if I......... i dunno hugged her or something out of nowhere. I don't know.

I had grandiose ideas about getting on here every day or so and typing up my thoughts through this process.  WELL, I'm over a month into this thing.  Not much written yet, but to tell you the truth, it's taken a bit of time to process this process, or whatever it is.  In any case, I'm ready to write about one of the more recurring themes from the last month...   Faith .  I spent the early part of June hurrying to get my resume out and check out every possible lead in the nation.  There were like three jobs out there, and I didn't get any of them.  And then someone told me to slow down and enjoy this 'process' - to not miss out on what God might want to teach me through this ordeal.  So the latter part of June, while exhausting even more leads and checking out every single college in Kansas and Missouri, I realized that I wasn't going to find something right away - that I was going to have to wait on God.  I should keep looking, but really trust that God will open the door when it's God's time.  And he knows what's best for me - his timing is perfect.  That's the test, really.  Will I 'faith' God to bring me safely to the next thing?  Will I trust him to show me where and what it is?  I feel peace about it as July begins.

That means that anyone who is online anywhere in the world who is playing the game is in the same world as you.

I left her group because no one would post hardly anything in the group.  She might be upset with me but do I care no I do not.  I am trying to find out if there was any names mentioned and if so that person was lieing big time and made me look really bad.  I just wished people would grow up and stop acting like children.

I have had many experiences in my life where I have thought my friends were 'there for me', however when it really counted only a precious few remained. It seems to me that there are two types of people in this world, one type being self centered, egotistical, tyrannical assholes....And the other type normal, sweet-hearted, kind people.  For example, last Friday evening my 'friend' went screaming through his apartment yelling that I was not allowed to use the restroom because he couldn't stand the end result. And he accually used the words:   'He is NOT allowed to use the bathroom ever, and I mean EVER.'   I let it roll off my back then, however thinking back, I am furious. Not only is that degrading and insulting to me, but my feelings never even crossed his mind. The only thing he was concerned with was his discomfort.  And then of course there is the other type, the ones when it all comes down to it, truly make a difference in people's lives. Unfortunately, they are all to few, and as I do count myself among their numbers. (and there are numerous people who would say the same thing) . At the end of the day, I find it a bit sad and somewhat troubling that I associate myself with those 'friends' that can't see far enough past their own selfishness to realize how their actions have consequences upon other people.  So to that end, from now on I have vowed to not let such actions go beyond my notice. If I see such transactions occur, either upon myself or someone I care for, I shall be heard.  I will not allow such atrocities to go unnoticed any longer.

Some trains were diverted to alternate destinations, but the accident - and I use that word in a general sense, for it was clearly no accident - occured on the busiest route in Toronto.

"", ""       17.06.04 (Thur)     arh... another meaningless day. How suiting... that I pondered over what m I looking forward to in life... again...    Well... the reason why this thought repeats itself... is due to the fact that my objectives are always changing. Perhaps this is my way of meditating and restating my directions. Personally, clarity of direction might be one of the factor for the need of strenght.    Due to the uncertainty in the pursuit of SA, the search for a back-up plan has started. This might probably sound most selfish and highly chauvanistic. But it is something any logical being will do. I have waited long enough...    The biggest problem with my taste of girls is the fact that I do not really target the looks first. Most of the time, an evaluation of the possibility of one relationship. Due to this characteristic of decision, more often than not, the first target is actually the person who felt mutually about me.    Yet... despite this almost ideal choice maker, my failures are still endless... as you can see from the result, I never suceeded. Something that always go wrong is that their feelings changed. Sadly, the change isnt mutual too. Being that once I chose a target, rarely do I change.    Coupled with the draining effect of caring for another, each time I create a target list, I risk weakening myself. But do not take this as a cry for sympathy. Being that my weakening can be seen as simmering down and an act of maturing.    This is also perhaps a form of evolution itself. Being weak means I need to spend lesser attention to step down my strenght for another.    Well... now... let me watch this extremely ingenious show, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway'... Its just so funny.

And more information from insecure.ws  urlLink Safari/help runscript: Proof Of Concept   The short version is that links which use the disk: or help: URI handlers (earlier reports only tag the help: handler) can be rigged to run arbirary code (in the form of scripts) on the user's machine with the user's privs. Anything you can do on your machine, the script could do.  Apple may have actually known about this for several months (according to some who claim to have submitted the problem to Apple). Exploits have started to appear online, so the issues has become much more serious.  Josh Larios (and others) have pointed out this method to 'patch' yourself:   Launch Internet Explorer.  Go to Explorer -> Preferences.  Go to Network -> Protocol Helpers  Find the 'help' protocol and click on it, then click 'Change'.  Un-check 'Use current application if possible'.  Click 'Choose Helper'.  Click on the 'Chess' application in your Applications folder, then click 'Open'.  Click 'OK' in the Protocol Helper Editor.

""]","[""       I am an pedant.  Here is my newest criticism.  Some movies will list actors in some not immediately apparent order, and qualify the list thus: 'In no particular order.'  Why do they do this?    Probably because some actors would get upset about being placed lower than they think their importance would suggest.  So 'In no particular order' is a cheap excuse; it's according to no criterion of value, so we didn't deliberately slight you.  But the very reason an objection would come up is that, while not in an obvious order (like alphabetical), the actors are in  some particular order !  They must always be in some particular order.  If it were possible to actually put them in no particular order, there would be no need to qualify the presentation with that absurd phrase.  Summary:  The reason it says 'In no particular order' is precisely because that is not true.  In no important order, or in no good order, or in random order might be more accurate.

I wanted to shreik out in joy. Actually, I think my other two fellow PC lovers did! I could hardly contain myself! Peter Cooper was sitting just a few rows away from us! We then spent then entire game gazing at him. Did the Sounds win? Who knows. Did Peter Cooper look scrumdiddlyumptous? Uh, yeah.  Now that we know that Peter is a Sounds fan, watch out!
