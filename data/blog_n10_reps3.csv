Speaking after the game Derek Whyte expressed his pleasure: 'It was good to get the win and take some of the pressure off.  Getting that first win was important and I thought we thoroughly deserved it.  We scored some great goals, the first from Juan was something special and I think a candidate for the goal of the season already.  I don't think that we had any failures in the team either.  Defensively we were disappointed to lose the goal in the manner in which we did.  Andy Wilkinson did most things right but Owen Coyle made life very difficult for him and I am sure he will have learnt quite a bit.  The partnership between Hinds and Ramon looks very promising and overall it was another excellent game and great value for money. A special word also for Kenny Arthur, his game was excellent today with a couple of excellent blocks and well in control of his box and his kicking, that was very pleasing, as was Kenny Milne's return which seemed to give us greater balance.'  CULT HEROES RESULT The voting has now closed for the Football Focus Cult Heroes.  There were many, many entries and the top three that go forward for National voting are Chic Charnley, Denis McQuade and Alan Rough.  There were 39 players voted for in total ranging from players from the 1950's right up until the modern day and it is a big thanks to all who voted.  The winner of the autographed ball is Brian Peters and we will be in contact with him shortly.  GERRY SET FOR THE KNIFE Co Manager Gerry Britton will be missing from action for the next two weeks as he will be going under the knife to cure a problem on his left knee.  It is mainly a tidy up that is required and it is something that has been troubling him since the end of last season and it was hoped that it would clear up but it is now requiring a minor op.    ROSS COUNTY GAME Confirmation that the scheduled Boxing Day game with Ross County will now be played on Monday 27th December with a 2.00pm kick off.

Started with 3 periods of March Past, ooh what a pain.Standing and marching in this disgusting weather. Then,&nbsp;picked up a fight, was rude to almost everybody and missed Sinha's debate (by 3 mins,&nbsp;when I reached the AVH, Akash's had just finished, really frustating). Well, it should have been a nice day, as it was the BIRTHDAY of one of my very good friend's (Kanika's ).   So I think I will just wish Kanika a very   HAPPY BIRTHDAY..  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   A good thing which has happened in quite a few days,&nbsp;other than India winning the match against the Lankans, is that Mukesh Sir is back, which has been a blessing. I mean we have a Computers MT next week, and it was&nbsp; becoming quite a pain to have different teachers, who literally taught us nothing.    Coming to the match, I think Dada showed immense captaincy. And I am not saying that becoz he is a fellow Bengali. Whenever he made a bowling change,&nbsp;there was always a wicket taken. And though before the last ball, he was biting his nails and changing field positions at the last moment, the way he exulted after winning the match was a sight to be seen. The most unfortunate of things is that i have Fiitjee on Sunday, when they play the finals.   I really hope they win the finals, it will make them&nbsp;supreme in Asia.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;<\\s>Firstly, a very  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  to  Sahiba  (25/07/04). May you grow more beautiful as the years pass by....    I was going to tell you about my eye checkup. Well that is part of the reason why I didn't write for two days. The other being the Indo Pak match. The whole Sunday whisked away in attending Fiitjee and then coming back home to see India hopelessly trudge a losen war (Sehwag went for 1, what else could you expect).   &nbsp; Anyhow, coming back to the eye checkup.

It was an awesome show and I really don't have much to say about it, other than Thrice rocked my face off and Dashboard played for an hour and a half. I went in hating Chris Carraba, and I came out loving him. He really is a cocky bastard, but a really nice guy. He has an amazing presence and really knows how to work the crowd.   Also, the fact that he sang 'I Will Play My Game Beneath The Spin Light' in the middle of 'Remember To Breathe' was amazing and I will admit that, yes, I cried a little.  I got home with threatening notes all over the place and I've been a wreck ever since. Breathing is such a chore, anymore.  I'm supposed to be getting some pills later, and then going to look at guitars. That is, if everything goes as planned. Which it won't.   I miss him.<\\s>I thoroughly enjoy(ed) floor sex.<\\s>I'm piss. I'm shit. I'm less than nothing.</s>"", "") Patroclus isn't so terribly hot either.     Random thoughts.  How nice that the city of Troy was set back far enough from the beach that the royalty could sit in the shade, sip mint juleps and comfortably watch a bazillion guys slaughter each other on the front lawn outside the city gates.  Speaking of a bazillion sweaty dead guys lying on the beach in the sun, I'm glad the plot made mention of the troops gathering and burning their dead, because after the first battle all I could think of was how bad the place would smell if they were left there to rot.  Speaking of the dead, each corpse gets coins on his eyes before he gets burned -- which had to cost a bundle -- except for the one character whose death prompts a conversation that specifically mentions putting coins on his eyes.    More random thoughts:  Every finger and every foot on the screen -- even in the heat of battle -- is noticeably well-manicured.  Which is nice, because nobody likes ancient warriors with scraggly cuticles.  Eric Bana's baby is frighteningly huge.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is a nicely nuanced, wholly complex character: savage in battle, arrogant in politics, tender and loyal in personal relationships, openly atheistic... and blessed with that amazing honey-baked ham tucked in the back of his skirt.  When the men take their shirts off, the camera often cuts them off right above the pubes -- which has given me a new appreciation for (OK, obsession with) the treasure-trail area.   So it's a very cool movie.  Go see it.  Bring a Kleenex if you don't think you'll be able to contain yourself during the butt scenes.

We corralled them to start heading back to Jean Lafitte's, as PJ and Drumm wanted to go there and relax. Drumm started buying shots, which was very worrying. See, the thing that worries me about Drumm is that he has an addictive personality, so when he starts boozing hardcore, not only does he hemorrhage a ton of cash, but it can (and many times does) lead him to do harder things. Anyway, we drank there for a while, then stopped at a pizza/beer/daiquiri store and danced to some rockin' early 90's tunes, which was awesome. After that, everyone wanted another drink, and Chaz wanted up on some balcony bar, so we did that. I got cornered by some shot girl (who touched my butt 3 times by the way) and i did a few shots with her. That sucked, sorta, except that the shots were superweak. Chazzy did a couple too, which made me happy. I went inside and some other girl tried to corner me with shots and I was like, 'do i have to pay for your cellulite on your legs too?' and she walked away. I think she got really pissed, but I was drunk, so I didn't care...  The rest of that night is a bit of a haze. I headed home because I was exhausted, and I think Chaz may have been with me. But i got back there and passed out. Then I remember everyone coming in at like 6 am, all loud and yelling. I passed back out. The next time I woke up, Wade was outside with the hotel manager and hotel security. I didn't know what the hell happened - I was asleep, but apparently we got complaints from all the people on the floor (thanks Wade) because of yelling and someone kicking on a door. That pissed me off super-hardcore, but I went back to bed, slept next to Charles butt-to-butt, and noticed that PJ &amp; Drumm were not present, but the bathroom door was closed. Ahhh, I should've known. This is why I'll never marry her...  So think about all that,  Cheers,  Cory<\\s>So, I'm gonna break this down and recap only one day of the Canteen at a"", "".  We all headed out to a bar, stood around, drinking cañas, eating tapas, shooting the poo.  Once again, there's never a lack of things to do in Madrid, so it wasn't long before I heard news of other parties lurking in the hidden corners of the city.  Zoë, me, and some other friends decided to go to a Warehouse Birthday party in Sol.  (There are warehouses in the center of Madrid?)  But we decided not to leave for the party until around 1AM. (The party started at 11, but we all know that people don't start showing until 12.  And we wanted to be the fashionably late posse that paraded in at 1.)  So, we rushed to get to the 'warehouse' by 1, because they only sent someone down every 1/2 and hour, to open the door for the newcomers.  It turned out that it was far from a warehouse, but more like a large office space that had been abandoned, and was taken over by a group of party crazed Spaniards armed with spraypaint.  It was good and all, but by 3AM, I was pretty pooped, so I headed back to Pappy's farm for some sleep.  And as I'm turning down my windy, cobble stoned, abandoned street, which I expect to be tranquil and serene at this hour, I can't help but notice the familiar sounds of House Techno Music blaring from some apartment.  And as I walk further down the hill, the music only gets louder and louder and louder.  So, as I turned the corner, and came into view of my apartment, it was no surprise to see it lit up light a Christmas tree, and people hanging out in droves on my balconies.  Joder.  So much for sleeping this off.  It turns out that where there is a will, there is a way.  They decided around 11 o'clock, right around when a friend of Juan's showed up with all of his DJ equipment, that they might as well have the damn party.  So they hit up the tavern across the street (No, they didn't jump, they walked) and bought a few bottles.  In fact, they made quite a few trips back there by the time I showed up.  It was a good scene. Loud but decent music, a good vibe, good people.  Might as well screw sleeping."", "":30.  the metro was crowded this morning. luckily, everyone on my train decided to look extra hot.  one guy in particular, i liked him.  we'll call him 'tie'.  he had a nice tie and generally that means that he's quite an intellectual.

Like, when that asshole pulls in front of you on the freeway, narrowly missing your front bumper by what must have been centimeters and then slows his vehicle down. And, he's not driving just any car. He's driving some whacked-up truck that a crack addict must have designed. It's so tall that you can't see around it, you can't pull around him because somebody is now on either side of you, and you're slowing down. These are times when you really just need a good shotgun. But, we all know we can't do that. So, we must vent. Another example is the coworker, friend, employee, client, etc. who won't get off their ass to do anything. Nothing at all. Even though it's their responsibility to do something, they refuse to do it. Then blame you when it doesn't get done. These people just need to be removed from society all together and stop wasting my time. I have had several clients who have done this to me. I give them advice to help steer them down the right path, but they consciously choose to not do it. I can't do it for them because it would be illegal and I don't want to be stuck with the bill. So, I keep advising them, but their ass is stuck to the couch. What the hell? And, when they run out of time, it's my fault. It's about this time that my sentences are composed of expletives and that's about it.   Lately, I've been watching the democratic convention and have been thinking it's pretty funny. I've never seen people say so many words with nothing of significance every coming out as politicians. That's pretty much all politicians. Who wouldn't want hope for the future? I sure do. Who wouldn't want all children to be well-fed, families to be out of poverty, healthcare for all, and everybody to be really happy. But, is this really government's responsibility? Is it their responsibility to provide for me and my family, make me happy, make sure that I make more than the poverty level even if I dropped out of school after seventh grade? I mean, c'mon on. As long as we exist, there will be poverty. There will be individuals, families, etc. who refuse to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them""]","[': 4 v FALKIRK 11 v St Mirren 18 v QUEEN OF SOUTH 25 v St Johnstne October: 2 v RAITH ROVERS 16 v Airdrie United 23 v CLYDE 30 v ROSS COUNTY November: 6 v Falkirk 13 v ST MIRREN 20 v Queen of the South 27 v Raith Rovers December: 4 v ST JOHNSTONE 11 v Clyde 18 v HAMILTON 27 v Ross County 29 v FALKIRK January 1 v St Mirren 15 v QUEEN OF THE SOUTH 22 v St Johnstone 29 v RAITH ROVERS February: 12 v AIRDRIE UNITED 19 v Hamilton March: 5 v Falkirk 12 v ROSS COUNTY 19 v ST MIRREN April: 2 v Queen of the South 9 v Raith Rovers 16 v ST JOHNSTONE 23 v CLYDE 30 v Airdrie United May: 7 v HAMILTON  SEASON TICKET NEWS With the club now back in Division One next season, a revamp of the season ticket prices has taken place.

While watching this very intense scene in the movie, I tried to take some popcorn for Palsy who was sitting right next to me, and unknowingly dipped my fingers into the coffee (ouch!) which he was holding( while reading this plz do not hold up ur nose coz whats going to follow is more dirty). But the best part was that he actually drank the coffee after that. Immediately after this, Sinha advised Palsy to get some injections for rabies, tetanus, etc.  2. After the movie ended ( which was quite a relief for the other ppl watching, as there were some frequent comments.), we went to McDs and there Sinha ordered an icecream. I had just helped myself to some when Palsy butted his head in between, in short resulting in some cold icecream on Palsy's hair. I will not elucidate further and let ur imaginations take u through this very weird scene. But the outcome of this has been that Palsy has vowed that he will stay some miles away from me while eating and watching any movie.  3. The thing which this point shows that we are BIG GLUTTONS ( yeah, we cant still beat Nisheeth at it, i agree). We decided to have our lateish luch at Pizza Hut ( do not think we starved till then, nachos, hotdogs, cold coffee, coke, of course we do not consider them as food but thats a diff issue). I decided to serve and lo and behold the pizza toppled over inside the pan itself) and the waiter just kept staring at us. I think he had never seen a crowd like this before.  Will not go into the finer details of this magnificent day, but by this time u must have understood what happened to the pockets of Kanika and Soumya, who took the undaunting task of treating us.

It's always either too personal or not personal enough. That, and I really don't think that anyone cares. But, after reading  urlLink Michael's  blog, I decided to post here. Let's see how this goes.  What's really been going on with me, you ask? School. School, school, and more school. The funny thing is, there's only been four days of it, so far. On Monday we did grammar. On Tuesday we did grammar. On Wednesday we took a grammar test and then started in the literature books. And yesterday we listened to the radio all day and read  Marigolds  and  Plainswoman. Poetry paraphrasing and creative writing. It's really not that bad. I don't hate it. It's just not Ritchick, though.  Yesterday I went to Columbia with Paul"", "" the Ballgame' in the entire history of bad tonality.  He was so bad and so off that I couldn't even find the notes myself.  And I've sung this shit professionally.  He was our choral leader tonight because apparently the Cubs have theme nights.  And tonight's theme was  washed-up TV stars with poochy tummies  '70s Night.  Which was actually kind of fun -- there were tons of people there in hideously authentic disco costumes.  And there was even one little anachronism of a kid sitting next to us in a hysterical Austin Powers getup, complete with wig and glasses and frilly shirt sticking out of an elfin velvet coat.  The 'us' in that last sentence was me and my very cool co-worker Andrew.  We decided long ago that we needed a Cubs night together so 1) we could do something fun that didn't involve direct mail and 2) he could teach me everything there is to know about baseball.  Because I used to know a little about it, but I forgot.  And I feel like there's this whole world of 'normal' (i.e., not gay) stuff to know out there and I've let it pass me by for the last 36 years. So I'm catching up.  Naturally, the one night I have a social life planned, I get stuck with a project at work that is due out the door tonight and is 1) way understaffed and 2) way behind schedule.  Which, ironically, is right on schedule in the strange and mysterious world we call My Office.  What's more, it's for a client team that I'm not even on.  What's even more, I'm catching a flight to NYC at 8:00 tomorrow morning to present it to that client.  What's even even more, it's midnight as I'm typing this at home (after watching the Cubs get CLOBBERED in the six innings we made it in time to see) and I would bet money the rest of the team on the project is still at work scrambling to finish everything in time for our early flight.

The thing that infuriates me though, is that I'm getting second-guessed on everything, and its getting old.  Originally, I was investigating a way to have the Canteen at Cape Hatteras, but good lord, you wouldn't believe how expensive that would've been.  Well now, dalas and Rich, the naysayers, are asking why I didn't choose to have it there.  When, for some odd reason, they forgot that it doesn't matter where I choose to have it, as its JM's, JS's and my fucking project, not theirs.    This business with the Canteen, however, is bringing about a fundamental change in the dynamic of this group of friends...we are becoming bipolar, with one side, represented by me, JM, KD, KS and all the others that have real jobs, and the other by KW and dv, the two that are obviously worthless sacks of shit.  Everyone else sort of falls into the gray area between those, but its gettin dangerous.  Wade has the balls to say, 'I can see them anytime' and decides to go to the Pixies show?  Fair enough, because when I'm home for the 4th of July, I'll be shaving my asscrack hair, because 'I can see Wade any time.'  And you can forget about the Temple - I'll be spending my money at any other bar, besides that place.

Next year, maybe I'll go to France and see Sagar or somewhere just for me...  I hate going home, in many ways.  I miss my mom and stepdad to death, and like to be sure that they're doing alright, but I despise seeing my little sister, and every john, tom and steven that you see at Wegmans (another inevitable trip).

He makes absurd generalizations, stereotypes The Favored constantly, and lumps me into a group of people I wouldn't be caught dead with. And Moore follows up these slanderous remarks with a quirky, humorous anecdote so he can defend himself from any criticism with, 'Hey, lighten up! It's Humor! Don't take it personally man!'  Well, that's where difference between humor and objectivity lies.  Yeah, the man can be downright hilarious at times.  But he's also trying to be a revolutionist.  He wants to spread the word, open our eyes, and instill some conviction in our collective apathetic hearts.

It never fails to amaze me how the human spirit has a certain strength within it to find hope in the worst of all situations. Call it our greatest evil or our greatest foolishness but it does give humanity a certain aura of glory. Of course apart from the hope there's always the element of how we manage to recover and regenerate from countless hurts and issues that threaten to plague us for the rest of our existence. I have always remembered the ending of Dickens'  Great Expectations... How the mists rose at the end of the novel and Pip moves on to a new ambiguous phase of his life. There are many ways to read that but for me, within the ambiguity lies a certain promise of growth and a happier future. The ambiguity also questions our very own beliefs about the human spirit's capacity to restore itself!!!

I can just hear the naysayers now, though. But not everybody has the opportunity! That's plain crap. Even the homeless have a place to go to clean themselves up, a bed to sleep in, some food, and the opportunity to get back on their feet. You show me a homeless person who is not at fault for them being homeless and I'll give you a moron.   What's ironic about the Democrats is that they pretend to fight for the little people. However, they are slowly trying to turn us into a socialist society and remove all of the freedoms that this country was founded on. But, hell, let's vote for them because they are raising the minimum wage. Never mind that prices will correct themselves so that your buying power of the dollar is decreased which amounts to your extra money not going as far as before. Or, let's ignore the fact that the vice presidential candidate is a money-grubbing lawyer who made his living suing companies in frivolous lawsuits so that our healthcare and insurance costs have skyrocketed. You think that doctors just happily pay for the multi-million dollar insurance policies they are required to have? No, that cost is passed along to us, the consumer. And, if we have insurance, that cost is passed along to our insurance companies who pass it right back to us with raised premiums. I can't imagine what this country will be like with John Edwards a heartbeat from the presidency. What happens if Kerry dies and while Edwards is President, something doesn't go his way? Is he going to sue? Democrats have already shown that they would sue, and sue multiple times, in the 2000 election (which is another blog and don't get me started on that one).

"["". Well he is a fucken dumbass, because I didn't set up no account.  Hey Kulixs if you see this....  FUCK YOU :D<\\s>Hey, Well I'am glad I get to update my blog :P. Well, last weekend I helped my cousins in painting the house. It was pretty fun, but pretty irritating. Especially the music my cousins put on the radio. It was a perpetual irritation. I thought I was going to throw up. Anyways I spent the other hours helping one of my cousins with the plumbing of the house. See, me and my parents are remodeling the house. On my part though I really didn't want to remodel it, since in eight to ten years the city council will tear it up to build a new parking space for the arena I live next to. But anyways, I'm glad we're almost done with the remodeling.    The next few days, I got some marxist and anarchist works from the library. I'm an extreme-leftist. And a Chilean friend that I met a few months ago changed my life. His family was killed by Pinochet. And I find it pretty intriguing that he started getting into politics at the age of six. For all I know, at age six I didn't even know what the word 'politics' meant nor what the U.S foreign policy was about. So I'm really grateful that this person came into my life, and opened my eyes to reality.    For that reason, I borrowed,  God and the State  by Michael Bakunin. According to the biography of this man, he was a well active anarchist. At the age of twenty-six he went out and fighted for justice. Although anarchism is my stance, I still found it interesting in how he proclaims the belief in God as ludicrous and iniquitous. Merely saying, God does not exist. According to the author, the primitive people of early human history were the creators of this myth in God. And ever since, it was used by the government to keep the majority of the people ignorant. A very interesting standpoint I say. Although, Michael Bakunin never finished this work, he did cover the French Revolution and since then the belief in God, was essentially a form of eclecticism. Deism essentially has been the excuse since then.   Personally, I find it pretty interesting in how he takes the belief in God.

Even if I never find a career or a purpose, I can still be successful. I see a lot of myself in Rod, and I think that's why I enjoy his company.

I fell in love, true butterflies in my stomach, shaky legs, sweaty palms love. And I found my love in the most unexpected place, in cyberspace!  It was a friday night, I had stayed late at the university, I was in the office where I was doing my social service after classes, trying to finish some homework, it was after 9:00 pm. so I called my dad to come pick me up, I didn't have a car at the time. I put my books away and I was about to turn off the computer but instead I decided to jump to some other web site looking for distraction, I went to this philosophy chat room but I can't even recall which chat room or how I got there in the first place. There were only 5 people in the chat room including me and the atmosphere of the conversation that was taking place was very heavy and boring so I decided to start a conversation of my own with 'Anaximenes' and that's where it all started. Today I don't even remember what we talked about but it wasn't anything important or personal cause I only stayed online for about fifteen minutes. For some reason I gave this mysterious character my e-mail address (not that I advise anyone to do so, you know you have to be careful online kids) anyway I didn't see any harm in it at the time and it was difficult for him to get any personal data from my e-mail so I said what the hell, he's not going to write to me anyway, I'll never hear from this guy again.  Funny thing but the very next day I got an e-mail from 'Anaximenes'. I really think this was the moment when I fell in love even if I didn't know it at the time.

I then turned onto Led Zepplein IV album, then to the Beatles - Revolver album, The Clash - London Calling album, and finally to the newest band: Velvet Revolver - Contraband album. Good music I say.   Then my friend wrote a poem to my aunt about how he loves her. It was pretty sweet. He says he got inspired by the Beatles, laugh out loud!

Actually everybody can have oily skin and acne problems not just geeks. Most people think this because geeks are less interested in their appearance than other guys and they don't care about a few pimples.  2. 'Geeks are boring'       Geeks are about the most interesting people because they are well read and they study just about anything. They always have something to talk about if you give them the chance. The only thing is that most geeks are so involved in their studies and projects that they have very little social contact, because of this they appear shy and they don't know how to act in social gatherings. Best thing is to talk to them one on one rather than in group.  3.

The rest can be interpolated on at a given time.

However, I may, occasionally, touch upon topics that are invariant.<\\s>The technique I'd like to cover today is a technique used to perform loop unrolling. Loops are often a good candidate for optimization. Do while loops, while loops, for-next loops all have a fairly similar structure: the provide a body of code to be executed within the loop, often with code that is dependent on the loop cycle (ie dependent on the variable used as the counter for the loop), and start and end conditions for the loop. Loops which are candidates for the use of Duff's device, may have a body which may or may not depend on the counter variable.  Lets take an example: How would one write code that copies one chunk of data into another? Typically, this is how it would be written:     send(to, from, count) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(--count>0); }     Let me ignore things such as bounds checking for the pointers, etc for now. (They are, however, extremely important) When the above piece of code gets translated into machine code, the body gets converted into a chunk of code, as does the condition checking and is followed by a JMP instruction. Typically, the JMP instruction, confuses the branch prediction logic in the processor, causes it to clear its instruction prefetch cache, and also, inhibit pipelining.  One very creative way of doing the same thing without the disadvantages listed above is the Duff's device:     send(to, from, count) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;register n=(count+7)/8; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n"", "" a boy/girlfriend, I'm still desperatly alone?

I had never seen the San Diego Symphony before, and they were a great accompaniment to the music of Styx. I am glad I went to the concert. So how does 'Xyst' fit in? Well 'Xyst' is the name of a game that I wrote on an Atari 800 back in 1981. 'Xyst' comes from Styx, my favorite band of all times. 'Xyst' was written in Basic and the object of the game was to have each band member find their instruments in a series of rooms. The only copy of the game exists on a 5 1/4 floppy disc in my closet - I hope it still works. Yes, I do have the Atari 800 still.<\\s>How did this blog get started? It involves They Might be Giants, Wil Wheaton and The Screen Savers. Read on. I was driving up to Anaheim with my sister to see They Might be Giants at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney. On the way my sister asked me, out of the blue, 'What's a blog?'. I told her that a blog was a web log, a journal style of web site. After seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 and eating diner at the Rainforest Cafe, we saw the concert, which was excellent, as TMBG always is. Even the opening act, Corn 'Mo, was fun. Corn 'Mo was a one man band who played an accordion and a foot symbol. Moving on. A few days later, I was watching the show  The Screen Savers  on TechTV, and they had Wil Wheaton as a guest. He was talking about computers and such, and then he mentioned that he saw TMBG last week and at the concert he talked to Corn 'Mo about blogs. Seems that Wil was at the same concert we were, and had the same converstion about blogs - scarry!. So my sister stared a blog on e-blogger,"", ""<s>Last night Robert and I went to see The Killers in concert. We were both pretty excited about the show as it was going to be our last concert together before I hit the road... as well as this being one of our favorite bands! So here we are at the Forum -one of London's oldest and possibly coolest venues- getting excited for what's promising to be a great night. We'd checked my bag, gotten ourselves a few drinks and moved along the main floor to watch the back up band until the show started. The back up was made up of two guitarrists who played as well as Lenny Kravitz... no joke.       So we're casually standing there, bobbing our heads as you do in a concert when all of a sudden one of the guitarrists throws a percussion instrument into the crowd. Unbeknownst to me, this projectile hits Robert square in the head. His initial reaction is: 'Did you see that? That thing just hit me in the head!!' So that's when I turn around. Of course... me being the shorter one of the two, I didn't see a thing. But next thing I know is that blood is gushing down his forehead... Robert tries to blow it off, saying he's ok but as more and more blood kept pouring out, I insisted he go get some first aid. Now get this - as we approach the bouncer, he tries to kick Robert out of the venue, thinking he'd been involved in a fight, and of course we had to explain the story to him and then the manager and then the first aid nurse. And that's when we're told 'You've got to go to the hospital mate - I think you need stitches!' They call us a cab and Robert insists that I stay for the show...which I did in the end. There was no point in arguing as he wasn't going to give in.   I make my way upstairs... steering clear of any other mishaps along the way. I buy myself a Red Stripe and The Killers come on. Song after song, the show just keeps getting better. Suddenly Robert comes up the stairs with a Jack and Coke in hand... and glue in his hair. He walked just in time for our our favorite song looking cool and relaxed. Lucky for him, they managed to glue his wound, instead of giving him stitches. He missed half the show but was there for the best bit...  As we walked"", ""<s>Been looking at getting back into cycling, it was something I used to enjoy but have not really done for some years.&nbsp; So I went to the big smoke; ostensibly to&nbsp;look at what modern cycling technology has to offer, but really to just get out and about a bit.&nbsp;I am afraid to say that three grand is somewhat excessive for a pushbike, I don't care if it is made from rare elements only found on distant planets, bonded with Kevlar and carbonfibre using strange hitech space age polymers and that it weighs less than a gnat's fart. It is still too bloody much. Besides, who needs that level of engineering in a pushbike?&nbsp; Maybe check out E-bay later.  I also think I need a change in career...

A cat in a box will never know what lies outside the box till it tries to jump out of the box. Innovation should never be stemmed. It contains the key to survivability.  Even so, the space program has yielded several direct benefits, both tangible and intangible. It provides several spin-offs to the economy. It has affected diverse areas of our general well being from the medical sciences to public safety. It has yielded several technological innovations, with little fanfare, which have affected the way we live. Temper foam, for example, used in helmets, airline seats, crash protection equipment, is an offshoot from the American Space Program. Laser Angioplasty, which saves many lives daily, owes its origins to technological breakthroughs made during the attempt to reach the moon. Communication as we know it today would not have existed had it not been for satellites, which orbit the earth: TV, mobile communications, Global Positioning Systems all owe their origin to space related technologies. Weather prediction, resource mining, all owe a lot to man's strife to surpass the boundaries of the globe. Space related technological has helped countries lead in global markets. It has several tangible benefits to the quality of life experienced by humankind. It is said that money spent on the American Space Program has yielded returns at about the same rate as expenditure on any other government expenditure. It provides employment to many. It provides the industry with a rich talent pool, something that one cannot do without.  Indeed, the drive to reach other planets is a force to reckon with. It reflects the indomitable spirit of man, his constant thirst for challenge and his ability to reap benefits from the results. Would it be wise to focus entirely on one sphere of human life (improving conditions on earth) and ignore the other?<\\s>Why are there so many ways to say no, yet so little to say yes! The human minds it seems is more geared to critically analyze issues rather than see the light. Every argument is based on some premises and some assumptions. There are no conclusions without any assumptions... it is always possible to completely bring down an argument. However it is so dificult to actually come up with an issue and see it through. There is ALWAYS a better way, there is ALWAYS something wrong. It is indeed dificult to scavenge through the talk and come up with a winner.<\\s>If something is the Bee's Knees, its the very best"", ""<s>Here's what you've been waiting for, striplings.    A little while ago, as I got home (home being Alex's right now) a guy in his car honked at me and gave me a suggestive gesture. I didn't catch his liscence plate number, but I didn't really think of it. I thought he might be a friend of Alex's, or Emili's (Alex's girlfriend), but they didn't know him.   Now, here comes the rant! Whats with old guys just automatically assuming hat its alright to make obscene and sexually suggestive gestures at me?! Do I look like a girl?   *yes*   But thats's completely aside from the actual point! People should have a little more decency than that! Especially adults, seeing as how they're running the entire goddamn country!! A lot of guys out there seem to like young, rather girlish boys, especially old and creepy ones.   Right after my gramma died, before I went to stay with Conrad (an old pal of my mom) I stayed at a guys house who was named Manny, and he said that he'd let me stay if I helped him out a bit. I agreed, because he owned a shop, and being the niave kid that I am, I assumed he meant help out in the shop. The next day, he takes my wallet from me and says come back after school. I really needed the wallet, or else I would have gone straight to Con's. I came back after school, and he's there, waiting, with my wallet in his hand. Not to go into much detail, let's just say he 'decided to have some fun with me'. No, he didn't get far, my boss (named Michael) came by, and scared him away. I managed to grab my wallet (thank god) and I took off.   Is there a growing number of pedophiles or what? Maybe its just that more are getting caught.    Phew. That rant went nowhere.

It desolated every home I have ever had. It has caused too much pain to let it live. You must accept that.” “May your body rot in the abyss,” The female paladin on the ground coughed between harsh wheezing. “No. I will not accept it.” The paladin reached out with what was left of her arm and coughed some gruff words. Out of her stub of an arm shot a bolt of white light. The bolt cracked its target square in the chest but he just shrugged it off. It seemed to energize him. A ring on his finger that was moments ago completely covered in soot started to glow a faint blue. “I thank you noble one.” He whispered. “But you are a bout to die and I must live to ensure that my mission is a success.” He reached down and touched the suit of armor that encased the destroyed woman gently with his fingertips. Instantly a blue flame engulfed his body and the armor started to fade, along with the little life that was still in the woman’s face. Power flooded his body and it left the armor and he could feel his strength return.  The blue flame slowly faded out. A gentle wind blew on the field of death blowing away the paladin, and her armor’s, ashes; never to be seen again. “Now,” He said resolutely. “To make sure this is truly over.” The ground beneath his feet heaved up suddenly nearly throwing him to the ground as a bright silvery flash broke the surface of the ashen barren. It rose quickly towards the white sun growing brighter the closer it got. It finally stopped and seemed to be consumed by light. “You will die defiler!” The light called. “I will destroy you Yai for your sins towards this land.” A blue flame engulfed Yai’s body. “Come get me dragon,” Yai shouted as he rose up into the air. “Or are you too cowardly to loose another arm?”  The light faded a little to reveal a tall draconic humanoid with scales like mirrors, clad in the same type of armor as the paladin.
