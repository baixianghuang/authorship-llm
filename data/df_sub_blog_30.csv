"       there are so many people in the world. Some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice. Reality sucks and everyone knows it. If you want a meaning in life then you have to find it. But if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in it.Is there really a choice in what we want? Why do people hate? does anyone Know? I htink that people hate out of fear. Fear of change, fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same. Everyone wants what they cant have, unless they dont have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything. But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple, but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique, we have our own thoughts, thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things, and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes, and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection, therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize.

Today my little brother was playing with my feet and it irritates me so much and he just kept on asking me why. i have no idea why thats just how i feel, i dont like it.

"           I just read Erica's blog. I had been waiting for her to post. She said a lot of stuff and it just really bugs me. Yesterday, it took so much to just try to get myself to ask her if she wanted to be there for my birthday. I honestly really wanted her there but it was a question of whether  she  wanted to be there. I didn't know and I was afraid she'd ignore me or just say no. I really missed her and wished everything could be okay again. I got myself to ask her and she said she could come. I saw Martin's display picture on MSN and thought it was really funny. It was a picture of him and Roger on White Water Canyon, looking really scared. The funny & cute part of the picture is the fact that they were really little. As in age-wise. It was just priceless. I thought about Erica the moment I started laughing at it and I knew that she was probably still mad at me and wanted me 'out of her life'. Since she wasn't ignoring me, I decided to tell her to look at Martin's display picture and said that I hoped it would bring a smile on her face. She couldn't see it so I told Martin to send it to her. He said I was a good friend to do that but I'm not so sure about that... She got it at last and thought it was funny too, I think. She said 'lol' or something so yeah. I just assumed she liked it. We talked a bit more about other things and yeah. She has no idea how badly I wanted things to be back to the way they were. No idea. I really wanted everything to be okay again, before this whole thing.   In her blog, she said that she was gonna take back what she said but then she read her comment on her blog page and wasn't so sure again. It was I who left a comment on her blog page. I wrote some stuff to clarify some things and I... I said that it wouldn't be a problem to stay out of her life. I guess I was just letting my pride get in the way again. I know that it  isn't  a problem, but it's not something I want to live with. Like I said, no matter what happens Erica would always be the one I go running to anyway. Even with the littlest things. She says I lecture her but I wouldn't know if I do or not. I don't mean to do a lot of things that I do. I mean, I'm me! It's typical of me to not know what I'm doing half the time. I think before I act or speak most of the time too!   I've tried acting perfect and nice. I've tried being Miss Nice Person but it's just... not me. Does everyone really think I love little kids? Sure, they're cute! Sure, they're nice! But I only like kids when they're nice! I wanna freak out everytime they start climbing all over me or bug me when something needs to be done that's actually serious with my friends. They  do  get on my nerves! But most of the time, I try to keep on a smile and just laugh along with them. Some of them are really nice (sincerely), some of them are annoying, and some of them just like bugging me on purpose. I'm not super-friendly. I'm not a great listener. I don't give the best advice in the world... And most of all, I act like a mom to Erica more than a best friend because I care about her a lot and I don't want anything to happen. Yeah, I guess I'm over-protective, but it's only 'cos I care. She knows I do.  It hurted that she had second thoughts about things. I really missed her. I wanted to be back in her life. I wanted things to be back to the way they were... even if we got on each other's nerves all the time. I love Erica as a best friend... I still care. Even if she wants me out of her life, I'd still care about what she does... I can't do anything about what she does but I still care so much... I just want her back.         ","           Here I am, just sitting in front of the computer yet again. I don't really know what I'm going to say in this blog entry but all I know is that my thoughts are just flowing into my fingers as my fingers are flying over the keyboard typing out my every thought. I don't know if I'll hide anything on this blog because I know that I've hidden some things in my public one. What I need right now is guidance. I really don't know what to do. Read Wilfred's blog and thought about what he had to say about the problem I was currently having. She cleary stated for me to stay out of her life. What do you want me to do about it? Why do I have to say I'm sorry when I don't even know why she's so pissed off at me. Is it because of all the stuff she said in her blog? That I lecture her everytime she talks to me about something? Do I really lecture her? I remember just not saying much about certain things! I don't say much when she tells me stuff because I hated how  she  always ended up lecturing me about everything! I turn to her with my problems with Nima and she ends up giving me this whole talk that I really didn't need. Instead of helping me think things out, that shit she said made things worse! It's always annoyed me how she tried to act all 'cute' too, but do you see me snapping at that? I hate how she snaps at me but I let it go every time. You never see me snapping at her! She doesn't even know this but she makes me feel so stupid every time she gives me one of her as-a-matter-of-fact comments. I really don't need that stuff but I just took it all in and kept quiet anyway.  Wil pointed out so many places in my old blog about how much I loved my best friend. Yeah, those were all true. It took a lot of troubles, sweat, tears, and of course laughs to get through to now. It wasn't me who told her to get out of my life... she told me to. It'll probably only frustrate her even more if I did anything about that. So what can I do? I can't force my way back into her face because of that.   Yeah, she's always been there for me. She went all the way downtown with me and all the way back up with me and was there when I was doing stuff with Wil. At the Candy Carnival she went outside and walked with me when I wanted to. Yeah, she was there all those times. But what do you want me to do about it? I can't do shit to get her to take back the 'get out of my life'. It wasn't me who decided to end this, it was her. And if that's what she wanted then that's that.   I know that she gets frustrated with me. I know that I'm not the greatest friend in the world. I'm not perfect... but the fact is: we've both changed into totally different people. From when we first met in grade 4 till now. Five years ago, we were just friends. She knew me as 'the girl who beat up Martin' and I knew her as 'the milky pens girl'. We sat together sometimes in Malin's french class upstairs and drew with her milky pens. In grade 5, we talked more and became best friends. We talked about Eric, Benny, and other stuff. In grade 6, we were still best friends and she was there too when I was with Ronen. In grade 7 last year, she was there when I was with Mike, when I was with Joel, and when I was with Wilfred. Even when I broke up with Wilfred. To be honest, that was one of the hardest things I ever had to do... break up with him. I can honestly say I loved him. What we had was definitely something special and something I could never forget unless I got into a very unfortunate accident where I lose my memories. This year in grade 8, she was there when I was with Nima and through all the good times and the bad. Finally, this happened and is this the end already? I have no idea.   Would it ever be possible that we get back together as best friends again? I have no idea. It could be possible but it also may not happen. I don't know.   Wilfred said that I would probably have too much pride to say sorry and stuff to fix it up and he's probably right. I do have too much pride sometimes to do certain things. I remember back in grade 4, Rachel and I always fought and always hated then loved then hated then loved each other. We were always fighting. We still ended up being pretty good friends. We were, in other words, inseperable. I've always been the one to set away my pride to apologize and she never was able to do that until later. I don't know why I can't do it now. It's just... unexplainable with words.   I skipped church for Wonderland? I wanted to go to church and then go to Wonderland a little later than everybody and meet up with them there but a few people needed rides and couldn't go unless they had a ride there and my mom wouldn't pick them up on the way to church to pick me up so I had to just go with them.   Katie said 'its not like u never skipped cd team!'. The thing is, it would've worked if she hadn't been there with me. Everybody has. That makes the statement killed. And the thing is, I didn't have anybody there telling me not to skip.   Everybody I talked to told this to me as politely as possibly because they knew that Erica and I were 'best friends' and I just kept quiet about what they said. Basically, they said that maybe it wasn't a good idea to bring Erica and Katie to our church. Bringing more people to church is always good but it probably wasn't the right time to yet. All they had ever done at our church was socialize and mack. Erica always complained about Katie and how all she did was mack and go to church for friends. The thing is, she's doing the  exact same thing . She said 'o thx joey for bringing me to church and God' and all that shit, but what is that? Shit!   She complained to me that all these guys were hitting on her and asking her out and then she turns around and goes macking right back and leading them on! When they ask her out, she just rejects them and continues flirting. Not healthy in my opinion.  She thought that I was talking behind her back but I wasn't. I was just talking to Katie about why she skipped. I was actually gonna speak to Erica seperately to see what happened. Katie being there for her? Why do you need someone to be there for you when you're on the phone with your man?! Erica's always complained and bitched about Katie this Katie that and then she goes telling me that Katie was there for her? Okay right whatever.  There's just so many thoughts running through my head and I just have no idea as to how I can arrange them yet. I'm not the one who called off this friendship in one day, okay? She did. If that's all this friendship ever meant to her, then I guess it's fine with me that she calls it off in  one day .   ------------------------------  From the movie Stand By Me, the main character said in the end of the movie that he never had friends in his entire life like the ones he had when he was 12. I find that very true... because once we all grow up and change into our own people, the way we look at things and the way we do things are different and it changes the relationships between us.  ------------------------------   Just one more thing I had to say...  I didn't show it but I was actually disappointed and kind of hurt that she told me to get out of her life. I really did care and I sincerely loved her as a best friend. She meant so much to me... and I don't know if she took me seriously but I meant it when I said she meant more to me than even Nima.         ",3918642,3918642,True

Also snagged a black dress shirt- mehr kuhl bohnen.  Then brought the happy couple back to Tri-County so Jesse could go home, and went to Steak n' Shake for a late-night dinner with Kathleen, Eileen, and Annie.  Not to my surprise, it was almost de ja vu as Eileen and Annie were going nuts drawing signs that say 'We're horny, call this #!' *shakes head*  I think the most awkward thing was that the restaurant was so fucking quiet and we were all laughing it up... Oh well.  We didn't get kicked out, so alles gute.  Then came home.  Alles so viel spass machen!!  (Lots of fun.)  Went to work today.  That was fun.  Covered the door for the first 1.5 hrs, then swung over to Starbucks, and went down to do my interview of the campaign ppl.  That was a lot of fun.  Caught up w/ Bev, who I haven't seen in a long time, and found out quite a bit about the campaign.  Wrote my article (nearly 1.75 pages... it'll have to hit the chop block) but zonked out after 45 mins... so went up for ice cream, then snagged a coke... got going to finish up.  Then went back upstairs to drop off mom's voter reg. card and talked to Faith for a little while.  And I  finally  snagged another positive comment on the 'new look.'  Not that I care, really, but the annoying thug/murderer/rapist/scary guy/sniper comments were just getting annoying.  Thus, hearing an 'It looks good on you.' was nice.

"             In a unknown state for the past 48 hours, here I sit. It is sunday afternoon, and I am not really sure what happened has happened to the time. Being gone for the past two days doing things with people I know, yet it feels like I did nothing at all. Well anyways, I am sitting here listening to some Jefferson Airplane with a bad headcold, trying to enjoy my last day of freedom before school begins again tomorrow. My teeth feel really weird too, but that may be from a mixture of smoking and alcohol but who knows. I am slowly coming to the realization that I am jerk, but only when I am with people I know. In my opinion this is because I am not afraid to tell them my thoughts about them, which may come off as me being mean to them. The truth hurts I guess. Well maybe I am not a jerk, I just tell it how it is, which makes it seem that way. For now I will leave you with my most eventfull happening this weekend, set on a friday afternoon...  School was boring and pointless. I really should have either stayed home or just skipped my classes and gone to other teachers classes. The latter probably would have been the best, more fun I presume. But I just went to my classes, and of course did nothing. The weekend finally arrived and I met up with friends after school. We do this every friday, nothing ever changes, I am going to start doing more, going places and seeing things. But anyways we made a call, and got a connection to Mr. Green. After a good session, we traveled to Tanasbourne to look at things. That is as far as I can get my friends to go, they would rather just lay around a house all day and do nothing, get fat, whatever, as long as I'm there we are gonna be doing something. The border I get the more truth I speak to them which they prefer not to hear. Well anyways, after that we got together with a friend of ours, Ben, and traveled to his house. In a strange encounter, we met his parents. One of which is a German import on a work visa, who took the liberty to offer us his finest German beer. I must say that it was quite good. My friends aren't much of beer drinkers though, except for Ben. Decent conversation continued, nothing spectacular or worth mentioning. After that I presented a joint to my partners, in which they could not refuse, so we formed a circle and quickly the crayon sized J was nothing but a little roach. I then took the short ride home from my frined Tom, the whole way afraid of certain disaster, a possible wreck or pig encounter, but we made our way back home safely. Marching straight to room, I told my mother good night, and found sleep almost before I hit the comfort of my bed.         ","             In this world, where do you stand?  No matter what anyone says, everyone fits in within a certain group. No one is completely alone. Some are more extrovert, others more introvert, but no matter, you can at least find one other person to relate to. And within these groups there are certain orders within them. Every group needs at least one leader, not everyone can be a leader. For a group to exist there needs to be a distinction between leaders and followers. Now back to the question, in this world, where do you stand?  For me, it differs. I have a two different groups of friends. First off is the group in which I am with a majority of the time. This is group of people that are my age, and I consider to be a leader in this group. I administer choices and make sure that the final decision appeals to everyone. But with my other group, which consists mainly of aquintances, I take a backseat and am more of a follower. I believe that this is because I am the youngest one when with them and am a little intimidated. I consider to myself to have an introvert personality, which the second group mainly shows.   But yeah, where do you stand? Do you like where you are? Are you a leader or a follower? Would you rather be the one you are not? What are you gonna do to change that?          ",3326024,3326024,True

"                 For anyone not familiar with the case, three years ago an Omaha Police Officer shot and killed a man in the line of duty.  He was originally charged with manslaughter, the grand jury acquitted him, the charge was dropped and not refiled. That's it in a nutshell, but obviiously there was more to it than that. Last week Jerad Kruse (the officer) was in court AGAIN because the family of the criminal was suing him in civil court for wrongful death.  Please.  Notice I didn't say the shooting victim's family, I said, the criminal's family.  He was a criminal.  He wasn't a victim of circumstance.  A victim of circumstance trips and falls off a curb in front of a bus.  A man who with a police record (who was recently released from jail) who steals a car, leads the police on a chase for more than 30 minutes, and then acts suspiciously, acts as if he is reaching for something and then raises his arms, is asking for whatever he gets.  I just do not have sympathy for his family because of how he died.  I have sympathy for his mother, just as I would have sympathy for any mother who lost a child, however, if he hadn't done the things he did, he wouldn't be dead today.  I don't care if he was red, black, purple or white, I don't care about the officer's race either.  I think it's ridiculous that they continue to harass this officer and his family because their criminal son is dead.   I am also sick to death of hearing how he was 'turning his life around'.  People who are 'turning their life around' are not out driving stolen cars and leading the police on chases through town.  There.  I've had my say about it.

"       It's now almost 2:15. In other words, this is gonna be mighty quick since I'm up *way* past my bedtime. I worked a half day last Friday (my day off), so I'm taking half of tomorrow off. Yay! Then it's off to Rochester for the weekend.  Work has been going really well in the last week since I've resumed work on parts that actually make it look like I'm making headway instead of munging around on well-concealed internals. Today was pay day as well. It sucks to see 30% of my bi-weekly paycheck going to 'deductions' ranging from taxes to 401(k) contributions. *sigh*  Anyway, good night world! I'll try to put something else up this weekend or shortly thereafter.  I'm going to continue to try to end my posts with something to think about. I read about a study today about sex education versus non-education with advocacy of abstinance. The study showed that among sexually active teens, both groups had the same percentage of STIs,  however,  those who never received sex education were significantly more likely to not know they carried an STI. This got me thinking again about why we as a society shun sex, while we revel in violence. Any given movie can have dozens of people shot to death in it and only garner a PG-13 rating, but reveal a breast, especially two and you're slapped with the second worst of all ratings: R. I guess it's little surprise to me that a society that deems the human body and sex to be more dangerous to its youths than murder, finds itself swimming in violent crime.  (This is *not* to say that I advocate censorship of violence from the media...I like to consider myself to be against censorship in all of its forms. Rather, I advocate re-analysis of the true danger that these topics present to the youths who are permitted to see them.)  ------------------------------------- Peace cannot be kept by force.

"           Pt 6b:  Capsule Allegories   The less adventurous of the group were heading back to the Capsule Hotel with the hope of being able to take advantage of an option that may or may not have existed.  Me and Wes deduced desperately that the jumble of Kanji we pretended we could read on the sign outside of the hotel earlier that day, aside from your basic spend-the-night-and-enjoy-the-onsen deal, that you could sleep for a maximum of 5 hours anytime of the day, pay a slightly cheaper price, but not have access to the onsen as it would be closed for cleaning. 　Fortunately, we were right in our assessment of the strange Kanji characters and we got a semi-descent 5-hour sleep that morning.    On the way there, Wes, initially, was making the most noise, as was the norm for him after consuming extreme amounts of a beer and whiskey mix.  Fortunately, Wes’ banter never lasted long because shooting his mouth off always indicated his inevitable decline into unconsciousness.  Friday night was no exception as after no more than 10 minutes into our walk he was barely able to lift his feet, let alone keep his mouth open.  Greg and Chris were merely drowsy.  Both cool cats almost always avoided drugs and were excellent at maintaining their alcohol threshold to a constant that allowed them to relax enough to dance, pose, and flirt, while not doing anything to look foolish, overly loud or boisterous.  I’d never known them to run their mouths, trip over their own feet, or pass out in inconvenient spots, but that’s just me.  Both experts at maintaining dignity, but perhaps sometimes overly concerned about their “cool” appearance to others.  Of course, that is just a guess at what could be.  But as for Chris and Greg in particular, I did not know them well enough to say if that generalization applied to them or not.  Ernie and I were chatting idly together (granted kinda in slow-mo due to remaining effects of a psychedelic) so as to make the walk back to America-mura and the Capsule hotel faster and less painful.    Then Ernie made the slight mistake of asking me what I thought about Capsule hotels.  One might think it was a harmless question, but directed to me at that point in time and state of mind, it opened a floodgate of information that many would not have had the patience to bear.  I told him that they (capsule hotels) were quite convenient but that were the perfect allegory of the Japanese “Salariman”, and more broadly speaking, the remnants of Japanese sexism.  Ernie was only encouraging me to bore them all with an abundance of University textbook regurgitation when he asked me what I meant.  Fortunately, one of Ernie’s great qualities was that he was an excellent ear when it had to do with extraneous facts and anecdotes.  Considering that this entire piece of writing (call it story, composition, funny anecdote, e-mail, a waste of time, etc.) is fairly extraneous in itself, I am nevertheless endeavoring to make it somewhat informative; partly for interests sake, partly as an exercise for my mind in an attempt to recall that which I spent about twelve thousand dollars on to learn.  Therefore, here is the gist of what Ernie heard:  Speaking of most First World countries, statistics show that Japanese women occupy a far lower percentage of the “White-collar” jobs in their native country when compared to their North American and European counterparts.  (Lucky for you, I don’t have the numbers with me as I write this, so you escape certain boredom with factual statistics.  In the meantime, you’ll just have to take my word for it.)  Of course, it’s not because of the political or legal structures of Japan.  Japanese women are legally guaranteed equal rights to jobs, wages, enfranchisement, civil rights, etc, as the men.  However, compared to many other First World countries, the advancement of women’s rights came about much slower.  In fact, it wasn’t until after Japan’s defeat in the Second World War and the US imposed its own political structure and judicial concepts on Japan during its occupation that the women’s movement started to gain momentum in Japan.  And even then, it was slow moving.  Most historians would agree that the reason for this slow progress was due to Japan’s reverence for its own tradition.  As a result of the defeat and occupation following 1945, Japan’s opinion of itself when compared to the rest of the world rapidly changed from a superior to an inferior complex.  They were essentially brought to their knees by the power of the American War Machine and, after the American society started to infiltrate Japanese media, they were slightly in awe of the “freedom” of American lifestyle.  However, 2000 years of tradition was not going to be erased so easily.  And then combine 2000 years of tradition with a 250 year period of complete, enforced isolation (ending finally in 1868) from any outside culture or society and you are left with some of the most stubborn set of ideals and beliefs that can be found anywhere in history.  Around the same time that the Western European Code of Chivalry was being defined as the standard set of ethics for the members of the Aristocracy and Knighthood (the Middle Ages), the Bushido Code of Japan was being developed as guiding principal for its upper class.  Both standards of behavior dictated that women did not belong in the battlefield due to their “inferior” physical and mental capabilities.  The women’s role was in the household and servicing the men.  However, according to the concept of “Chivalry”, women should be treated with respect and often deserved to be placed on a pedestal.  Women represented the purity of life that men loose in their day-to-day life; whether it was in battle or managing their estate.  Women should be valued for their beauty, artistic capabilities, loving, tender nature, and for the ability to bear children/heirs.  It was so important to recognize these values of women that many people decided to write about it; sometimes in novel form, poetry, and even dissertations.   The female counterparts in Japan did not enjoy this kind of acknowledgement publicly.  Certainly a Japanese husband would often privately respect and consult the mother of his children, but women were definitely not placed on a pedestal.  This accounts for one historical source of a woman’s position in Japanese society and why the women’s rights movement advanced much more slowly in the East as compared to the West.    Back to my original point:  Japanese women occupying a very small percentage of “white-collared” occupations, especially the higher-ranking ones.  And now for the allegory of the Capsule Hotel:  A Capsule Hotel is a special kind of over-night lodging that rent “rooms” by the day.  They are geared mainly towards the “Salariman”, but of course are enjoyed and utilized frequently by other employees in an occupation that requires them travel away from the “base of their operations”.  Maybe for business trips, traveling sales, attending training and info seminars, traveling to branch sections of one’s company, etc. the Capsule Hotel is the most ideal form of lodgings one can obtain.  Why?  Because they don’t require reservations, they are much cheaper than a regular hotel, they offer almost any kind of service one would need for a 12-24 hour period, and they have onsens.  You can eat, kill time by watching TV, fall asleep in huge recliners, wash and soak your worries away at a Capsule Hotel.  The only thing that might leave people skeptical (without ever staying in one beforehand) is that your “room” is essentially a box.  However, this box is long enough for someone who is 6`4” to layout in and high enough for him to sit up right.  Each box comes equipped with its own alarm clock, air vent, and TV set.  The rest of the facilities are shared by all occupants. If you’re only there to spend the night before having to go to work early the next day, what else do you need?  Why is a Capsule Hotel a man’s environment?  Well, obviously because in 95% of Capsule Hotels easily found, women are not allowed.  Apparently, co-ed Capsules exist, but I have never seen one.  Why aren’t women allowed in?  Because the men walk around with only thin robes on, they fall asleep practically exposed on the cushy recliners, and of course, no clothes are permitted in the single onsen room.  Men practically give up their clothes after signing in, walking around almost naked, sleeping almost naked, slurp their noodles almost naked, and sit in front of the TV almost naked. Why don’t they alter the “no-clothes” system or make two onsen rooms so that women can enjoy the facilities as well?  Because there aren’t enough women who would find a capsule hotel appealing enough to make a fuss.  Perhaps a Capsule Hotel just isn’t appealing to most women.  At the risk of sounding sexist yet in all honesty, professional women are required by trends of the latest magazines, TV shows, and international style to spend a lot of time on personal grooming.  A capsule hotel is not designed to accommodate that.  Of course then, this is quite the vicious cycle.  Women don’t complain because a Capsule Hotel fulfills only male stereotypes.   A Capsule Hotel appeals to a typical male because the only women around are the cleaners and men can be totally “free”, without inhibitions.  Women aren’t around because they are not permitted.   What male stereotypes am I talking about?  Ramen and beer are the main form of nourishment in the hotel.  We don’t have to “shield our dignity” from anyone who might be offended.  Capsule TVs and the shared big-screen only seem to play baseball/sumo games, the daily news, and most often, pornography.  How often do women spend the entire night on lazyboyz?  How many women have a beer for breakfast?  How many women are comfortable enough to leave their robes untied while walking through the halls of a hotel?  How many women enjoy playing strip poker and naked majong in the video arcade?  Some, but not many.    By this time, we had safely reached the convenience store across from the hotel.  We bought our waters and cigarettes, went to the lounge on our floor, sat around almost naked smoking and looking stupid.  Not much was said anymore, except to agree for the 136th time that it was a good night/a funny night/a crazy night or all of the above and that we were definitely looking forward to some hard-earned sleep.

"       So I went to my reunion and it was all the things that reunions are. There was heavy drinking, talk of marriage and babies, reminiscence of parties past. I spent the next day vomiting - feeling almost like I really was eighteen again.  To take a break from all the political ramblings of my previous posts, I would like to make a list of the things I did not do while in St Louis because I was too hung over:  1. I did not go to a 'real' thrift store where prices are still under five bucks for almost everything (unlike the 'vintage' stores here, where everything costs as much or more as that crap they sell at the Gap.) I did get some cheap crap at Target, though. More on that later.  2. I did not eat a greasy taco from Jack N' the Box. This truly makes me sad, as I do so love a good greasy taco. However, I did have the Chili Five-Way at Steak'nShake, which my boyfriend (a stranger to the ways of S'nS) prounounced 'spaghetti and ketchup on a plate with chili on top.' Philistine.  3. I did not take my boyfriend to see anything even slightly scenic, other than driving past the Cahokia Mounds on the way to a classic car showroom with my dad. The cultural commentary consisted of 'Hey, Paulo, those hills are made of dead Native Americans.' To which he replied, 'Nuh-uh, really? Can you see any of the dead people?'  4. We went to Target (no small feat here in NYC, as they cater to those with cars and also kind of suck compared to the giant megastores back home), and I did not buy the giant econo-bottle of Dove shampoo for $5. That was a mistake. We did get a nice bathroom rug, however.  5. I did not watch 'Grosse Point Blank' before we went. At the reunion, during which I sucked down about a pint of Johnnie Walker Black, Paulo made a reference to sniper rifles that would have been hysterical had I not I missed the point completely.  Eh. There's always the twenty-year. I'll probably still be broke, living in sin with my boyfriend in little box-apartment in NYC with twelve cats and nary a kid in sight...I'll be sure to remember to snag me a couple of Jack N' the Box tacos then, even if it's just to reassure myself I'm not a total failure.     ",        An excerpt from a note I'd sent someone explaining how I got to Houston from NJ...       '  I'd been in Seattle - lovely lovely Seattle - when I made the mistake of getting married to and pregnant by a guy who was going to get his PhD faster than I was. Got dragged to Houston. Now I'm stuck here like the backs of your legs to a hot vinyl car seat...'          ,4129240,4039232,False
"       Dunno really what to write but I had this feeling to write something, even if it's bullshit.  I meet up with my dad yesterday. We drove to the Plus City and he bought himself a pair of trousers. I mean the ones u can use for sport activities. He's now into 'Walking' if someone of you knows that. lol. Last summer it was jogging, now walking and he said he's planning to do some cross-country skiing in winter. He wants to abate xD Yeah but anyway, after that he wanted to buy some eatables b/c he was on a tradeshow (he's an exhibitor) and tole me he has nothing in the fridge. So we went to Eurospar. He said I could pick what I want and so I picked some sweets *eats a toffifee* xD'' I'm stupid. I always say I'm to fat and than I buy (or let buy) tons of sweets > Okay after we brought all the stuff to the car, we went to the Megaplex (cinema) to buy the cards for 'Traumschiff Suprise ~ Periode 1'.  After that we went to Cosmos. I like to grub in the DVD section. Since I haven't found 'Far from Heaven' in the Saturn stor in the city, I wanted to look for it in Cosmos. I didn't even have to look for it! It was right on top of the front row. I looked at it but put in down again. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to have a DVD b/c he would buy one for me. I was like 'o______O' I knew my dad's really generous but I was sunned :) I told him that I want 'Far from heaven' so badly and he bought it for me :D *jumps up and down* Then we walked to the cinema and watched the movie. I watched it the sec. time but I like the film, I really have NO idea why most of the people dislike it ~~' If you don't expect that much or expect an incrase to 'Der Schuh des Manitu' it could be funny :)  Today I watched 'Far from heaven'. GOSH, Julianne Moore plays her part SO well *is stunned* I can understand by she was nominated for the Oscar (you know, when Nicole Kidman won for 'The Hours' - best female leading role) but I can't understand why she didn't win... Don't get me wrong. Nicole was absolutely ingenious as Virginia Woolf and I LOVE the whole The Hours movie more than any other movie but I really think that Julies role in 'Far from Heaven' was a bit better played. Maybe I say that out of my Julie-Obsessed-(hopfully-not)-phase. BUT if you ask me I would have nominated Julie for her role as Laura Brown in 'The Hours'. I never heard of Julie before 'The Hours' and I was completely stunned by her acting talent when I saw her as Laura Brown. Gosh, she's so great! She would deserve the oscar for that role BUT this fucking oscar jury didn't even gave her the oscar for the best supporting actress (she was nominated for The Hours -> Laura Brown). FUCK YOU ALLLLLLLLLL !!! >  Right now I'm listening to 'Kiseki no Umi', the opening song of 'Record of Lodoss war' (it is Kiseki no Umi, right Katja?). This song is soooooo beautiful o_____O WOW O.O But it reminds me a bit of this one Vangelis song calls 'Adiemus'. Don't know why. But it is really beautiful :D  That's all for today. Maybe I'll blog more soon =)          ","          Baaaaack O_O  It was AMAZING...once again, this movie showed me how gorgeous Julianne Moore is...and she's such an actress ! *adore* But I love the whole 'The Hours' movie. Teresa was stunned, I recoginiced and she said it more than one time. I can absolutely understand her; the film is too amazing to dislike it ! When we got to the cinema, the whole adults were starring at us, wondering what we're going to do here and praying not to sit with us in the same movie... it was uncomfortable and we felt misplaced but after a period of time we didn't care anymore and just had fun. The movie started half an our later than it was written in the programm b/c of a play which was outdoor - and next to the summercinema - as well.  Teresa and I met up at 5:00 pm as I wrote and went around in the city. We decided to go to 'Douglas' to test some parfumes b/c we want to paste up our table with those white strips you're spraying the perfumes on lol o_O So we went around and testet and we agree on the smell of Channel No5...it smells like a cloaca *g* Don't know why the people are so crazy about it but not only this one smells REALLY bad oO I doubt I'll EVER buy a Channel perfume ;) I would like to buy this pink gucci parfume or J'adore from Doir. They're great if you ask me xD But anyway, we always have so much fun in there...I think this mixed up odor makes me dizzy O_o lol o_O And Teresa as well *g* The salegirls were starring at us as we just took refug from the madhouse. But hey, as long they don't oder us  to stay away from the shop, we'll come back - for sure :P  I'm going to make some dolls now (Katja, you affixed me ;)) lalala *jumps up and down*  Edit: Just noticed that Ayu's looking    very creasy     on my icon-picture o_O lol   Edit2: Start in the next day wasn't that good as expected ><><>       stomachache      is nearly killing me and I'm so fuckin' tired >  I just canceld the meeting with Teresa today...We planned to go to the Pöstlingberg and go with the Grottorailway (lol, this translation of 'Grottenbahn' was written in a touristguide xD)...But yeah, maybe tomorrow or so....*rubs her eyes* >                   ",4145578,4145578,True

Well...in Grind....I'm Eric Rivers ( blonde hottie), Alana is Dustin(Adam Brody, the hott guy from The OC), Sarah is Matt(the weird crazy guy) and Kindall is Sweet Lou (the guy who thinks hes gods gift to the world...lol and he plays  in Cabin Fever) Well not that i jsut wasted like 10 mins typing all  that..Im so bored....sittin here listenin to the Von Bondies 'c'mon  c'mon' that song has an awesome bass part..Kindall should learn it.  but her gay computer was hit by lightnin and it doesnt work...oh the  luck she has...lol.ok its been 20 mins since i typed all that...i'll  finish the post later...sry im gonna pass out im so tire...lol ok  maybe im not that tired but im getting there....later    ","       (I wrote this on June 27 and just not got it on here....sry for someone who has no life I sure am behind...)  well today was so boring...Yea great way to start off the first entry but who's reading anyways! Well my 3 best friends ever( Alana, Kindall, and Sarah) went camping Thursday night and I was suppose to go BUT of course I had to work..I called in Friday told a tinny tiny lie and got at the camp ground around noon....it was great..they had met these 2 guys One was all shaggy hair skater, the other was like im black( he was so white). Anyways they were really awesome.   Well it couldnt stay great too long. My Aunt(Alanas mom...shes my cousin...really). Came to get her around 5 that afternoon...They were going on a 'family vacation' for one day...yeah its gay i know believe me. My aunt didnt even plan it till after we planned the camping trip.   That night(without Alana) we went snipe huntin'. If ya dont know what that is you need to get out more. Its great. We took Kindall's little brother and his friend. They had no idea what it was...so it was Me, Kindall, Sarah, Travis, Josh(2 guys we met) , Paul, and A.J.(bro and friend) in the woods pitch black with 2 small flashlights and 2 plactic bags. Well Kindall, Josh, and Sarah left me and Travis with the new guys. They were gonna meet us at our special place while we waited for Paul and A.J. to find us. Travis and I explained to them what they were suppose to do and they were so excited...i told them i needed the flashlights so they wouldnt scare off the snipes and of course they were like oh you're right here ya go Al...im just like this is too easy. Well they started 'huntin the snipes' and I grabbed Travis and started running and aparently he wasnt paying attention and just stood there. I forgot to take my flip-flops off so i could barely fun. it was horrible. There I was running in the woods, pitch black, with flip-flops on, and there was a lake around where i was running and i had to make sure i didnt trip and call off the narrow bridges and fall in.  I got back to the special place and waited and waited and it took forever for the other  guys to get there. They found Travis, A.J. and Paul on their way. They were laughing so hard they could barely stand. When Paul finally realized what was going on he started running after me and fell and scratched his whole stomach and leg up. I felt kinda bad but hes the one who wanted to go. Travis was sore that i supposedly left him but he just stood there so hes his fault he was left in the dark. After we all recovered from snipe huntin' we walked around forawhile to get the bags Paul and A.J. left of the trees. Then we went back to the camper and listened to music. The Travis and Josh left and we talked forever and finally went to sleep.  Then i had to get up at 8 the next morning which was today and drive all the way home and be at work at 12. IT SUCKED MAJOR BUTT!!!  I was having the most awesome dream about Brandon Boyd(lead singer of incubus). We were at my house about to go swimming. Then off of a sudden I hear Kindall and Sarah screaming AL GET UP!! AL AL AL AL AL ITS TIME TO GET UP!! I am definitely not a morning person. When i finally decided to get up it was okay because Melinda(Kindalls mom has breakfast cooked....it was good!  Then i went home....went to work from 12-7 and did nothing....practically stood around all day...and ya think well thats a pretty good job...getting paid $7 an hr for nothing. but it sucks. I'd rather be working non-stop then just stand around for  hrs. then i came home and went to sleep till like 9 or 10. and played my awesome guitar who i missed so much while i was gone. His name is Kurt Don Armstrong for my 3 favorite guitar players. and now its almost 2 in the morning and im so tired i cant sleep. just sittin here listening to Chris Carrabba sing his heart out while i rant on and on about the life i dont have..lol. how awesome am i...well if you read all this im sorry you have no like. but thanks.lol later    ",3879361,3879361,True

"        good morning I, sometimes i think only my kids 'get' me. nobody else in the world can get me all the time. my 12 yr old girl knows exactly when i'm getting grumpy before i even recognize it myself...(talk abt an early warning device!) she's great that way...she goes: 'Mom, why are u grumpy?' & i yell back 'No, i'm not!, i'm just...Wow, ur right, i am a little pissed off...&amp; then i stop & think...' so she's wonderful to have around. &amp; then my little one, has a way of melting my heart. never fails. whatever mood i'm in, he heightens it into a positive note...every morning, before i leave for work i have to kiss him & greet him a beautiful morning even tho. he's still sleeping...just looking at his face makes my day. but on the weekends, forgedaboudit! he becomes some kind of a little dictator around the house...yelling orders like: 'I want cartoons!', ' I want ma-mam &amp; i want ma-mam now!', or 'Mommy, let's play!!

'trying to have a conversation...'  & we become quiet, lost in our own train of thoughts.  that kinda summarizes our 5-year marriage...still trying to have a conversation...a real conversation.   ...hmm, what brought this up? i don't know, just missing my kids during some free time at work.  i'm so pathetic!      but hey, i don't want to dampen anybody's day that's turning out to be sunny &amp; gorgeous after all...despite the weather forecast,   so, 'keeping on the sunny side'...   till then,       ","         Hello there I,     it's friday again!!!   i get to take my daughter to work today (she's 12 & she can take care of herself while i'm working...so, no problema...), also my boss is not in, the other big cheese is on vacation &amp; it's casual day too!  we get to hang out in the city after work ( which is an early day for me...i'm off by 4pm) so what better way to spend this day but with my daughter?!
