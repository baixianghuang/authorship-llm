"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon

RE: DEC. 6 LUNCHEON / ANNUAL MEETING
 



Ladies:
 



December 6 is not only our holiday luncheon but is also WEN's annual 
meeting.  Pursuant to our current by-laws, I appointed a Nominating Committee 
to assist in  selecting the WEN 2001 Board. The Committee has worked 
diligently to interview  the potential candidates from the final list 
submitted in accordance with the  Nov. 10 deadline. The Committee will submit 
its final recommendations for  officers and directors at our Dec. 6 luncheon, 
at which time the membership will  vote on whether to approve the new Board. 
Additionally, the WEN members will  vote on whether to approve by-laws 
revisions as approved earlier this week by  the Board. In summary, the 
by-laws reflect changes necessary for the continued  phenomenal growth of 
WEN: Dues were increased to $30; two Board positions were  added, the 
officer/director nomination process was clarified, among other  changes. 
Please feel free to review the by-laws before voting on Dec. 6.? I  hope that 
many of you will be able to attend the luncheon. It will be a great  program 
and a nice conclusion to another great year for WENH!
 



Robin

Hi Guys,

I still have not confirmed anything with the old Biddy's team so I suggest
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as I do.
Check out the scrimmage Keith found at the Washington Park soccer field on
Sunday at 11.  He says its open and ok for us to take part. The field is
close to but South of the Rose Garden, Trolley Station and closest too but
down hill from the kids playground.  To get there from the Rose Garden take
the Road to the left which brings you back into SW Portland.  Hope to see
you there.

Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

""Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week.""

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line. 

Jon

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

1
REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts.""

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said,
""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.""

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?""  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing...""

"My friend at CPSB (Johnny Forbes) and I were talking last night and he told 
me that RHLP had been running test on their Ranger system which is the system 
that will run CPSB generation and interface with the ISO.  Johnny says that 
for the last three weeks, each time that RHLP had tried to run the Ranger 
system the Joint ACE and the units would not respond.  Their are many bugs in 
the system!

Johnny said the CPSB Ranger system is still in a box on the floor in the 
Control Room.  Their is talk at CPSB that it will be at least three months 
before the ISO begins to work as planned.

Johnny also told me that the Texas State Senate had passed some sort of Bill 
that would allow Ercot to postpone the Deregulation process.  According to 
Johnny,  ERCOT is just waiting for someone  ( ENRON, RHLP, AEP-CNTRL etc. ) 
to say they are not ready before they exercise this option.

"Sunday evening, December 10, 2000

COMMENT: On December 5, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke. He said that the
""wealth effect"" has been ""significantly attenuated"" thanks to the drop in
stock prices. He also acknowledges that our economy ""is obviously at
increased risk of untoward events.."" He is right, of course, and in a
position to reduce this risk by easing monetary policy. Ironically, his
latest speech follows by exactly four years the one in which the Fed
Chairman famously asked, "".how do we know when irrational exuberance has
unduly escalated asset values.""

More and more these days, I hear from various well-connected business
sources that sales ""fell off a cliff"" since the summer. This is confirmed by
the steep drop in consumer confidence during the first half of December and
Intel's warning last week about sudden order cancellations. Despite this
warning, large/mid/small cap tech stocks were up last week by 8.1%, 15.2%,
and 9.9%, respectively. Could it be that the bad news is mostly in stocks
and that the market is starting to anticipate Fed easing soon? I think so.

SUBSCRIBERS: The risk is that Fed easing might not work to avert a recession
this time. This ""pushing-on-a-string"" fear was frequently raised by Asian
investors, who I met last week in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Many of
my friends in Japan see lots of disturbing parallels in the US today with
their unhappy economic and financial experience during the previous decade.
I reminded them that there are still 650 basis points left between the
federal funds rate and zero. For more on this subject, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. The topic for Monday's WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM: ""Will US
follow Japan's bubble script?""

PUBLIC: You can decide for yourself whether it is too late for Fed officials
to avert a recession, and how quickly they can get us out once they start to
ease by tracking numerous KEY WEEKLY indicators on the HOME page. You'll
find initial jobless claims, bank credit, mortgage applications, and more.
In his latest speech, the Fed Chairman said he still believes that the
secular rebound in productivity growth is intact. I agree. You can find his
speech in the GREENSPAN CENTER and our updated (Dec 6) PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS
chart book on the WHAT'S NEW page.

SPECIAL ELECTION CONFERENCE CALL: On Friday, Nov. 10, Mark Melcher, an
independent political analyst, and I discussed the likely consequences of
the Presidential election mess. You can listen to the rebroadcast at
www.yardeni.com/waf.asp.

DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX. BROWN'S TECH 2000 CONFERENCE: Watch this premier annual
tech conference live from Nov. 13-16. I will speak on the outlook for the
tech industry on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 11:30 am (est). Register now at
www.webevents.broadcast.com/db/techconf1100/frameset.html.

COMMENT: In the latest Congressional elections, the Republicans still held
on to their majorities in the Senate and the House, but barely. Whoever is
the next President has no mandate whatsoever. The voters in their collective
wisdom have given us the most gridlocked political system in our nation's
history. This suggests that the country is evenly and hopelessly split into
two factions with very different agendas. Or else, the country is mostly
satisfied and prefers to veto both the Gore and the Bush agendas. I think
the latter is a more accurate interpretation of the Presidential and
Congressional votes. Obviously, this political stalemate could be a
decidedly bearish outcome, especially if the legitimacy of the new president
is questioned. More likely, the new president and Congress will seek out
common ground for bipartisan legislative initiatives. The stock market may
remain on the defensive until this outcome is clearer. In any event, extreme
policy changes are now almost certainly extremely unlikely. This should
ultimately be bullish for both bonds and stocks.

SUBSCRIBERS: For more of my thoughts on the election, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, which also includes my outlook for profits in 2000. The
latest EARNINGS WEEK reviews the significant drop in consensus earnings
expectations.

EXCERPT (Nov. 6 GPS): ""Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at a
conference in Santa Clara, California on the impact of new technologies on
the real estate industry. While I was in Silicon Valley, I also stopped by
the Deutsche Bank office in Menlo Park. It is located on Sand Hill Road, the
West Coast's Wall Street for high-tech startups. The well-manicured road is
lined with the offices of venture capitalists (VCs). I am happy to report
that while the tech wreck in the stock market may have wiped out most
dot-coms, their financiers are alive and well. They are regrouping and
working hard to find and incubate the next New New Thing.

The VC phenomenon is a vital and unique aspect of the New Economy. The New
Economy is driven by a New Paradigm. The New Paradigm is actually a very old
paradigm called Competition. The most important characteristic of a
competitive market is that there are no barriers to entry. One of the
greatest barriers to entry is the availability of financing. The VCs have
virtually eliminated this barrier in the technology industry.

Of course, the Sand Hill Gang went too far over the past year. Money was too
easily available for any startup with a dot-com included in the company's
name. Early in their studies, economists are taught that in competitive
markets, marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The VCs gave away too much
money to too many harebrained entrepreneurs, and the result was probably
close to a zero marginal return averaging the many small losers with the few
really big winners.

The willingness of VCs and their limited partners to take on enormous risk
to finance entrepreneurs with untested ideas and innovations is a great
source of the New Economy's creativity, strength, and productivity. In the
past, entrepreneurs were stymied by the unwillingness of bankers to take a
chance on them. In the 1980s, Michael Milken revolutionized this process by
raising money for entrepreneurs directly in the capital markets. He invented
the concept of issuing high-yield bonds as an alternative to bank financing.
The VCs have taken this concept to the next level. Instead of entrepreneurs
searching for financing, the VCs are searching for entrepreneurs to finance.

Many of the VCs are relatively young, in their 20s and 30s. So are many of
the portfolio managers of the technology mutual funds. Just for fun, I often
ask these folks if they know what VC once meant before venture capitalists.
Most of them are stumped. During the bad old days during the war in Vietnam,
it stood for Viet Cong.

Today's VCs are also well trained in the art of the ambush. They are
constantly on the hunt for new-new companies that can put old new-new
companies out of business. They are today's financiers of the process of
""creative destruction,"" which was brilliantly explained by Joseph
Schumpeter. This means that no business is safe from competition. Indeed,
the most successful and most profitable businesses are the ones that are
most at risk from a deluge of VC money financing wanna-be competitors.

The bottom line is that technology will continue to be the most innovative
and the most
competitive industry, with great rewards and great risk.""

"Matt,

Thank you for your note.   I understand that the reporting requirement 
(According to the Korean Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations(""FETR""), a 
prior report to the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction 
whose underlying assets are not financial products, i.e., ""Commodity 
Derivative"" by our own definition.) is a legal issue to be clarified and 
handled carefully.   However, speaking with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai 
Oil, I have the understanding that the Bank of Korea is willing to be 
flexible enough to accommodate instantaneous on-line derivative trading.  We 
might need official confirmation of this from the Bank of Korea, but I think 
that, working with the Bank of Korea, we could find a solution to this legal 
issue.   The following are some of the facts regarding the reporting 
requirement issue:

Although the Bank of Korea has the legal discretion to reject any report 
made, when I spoke with them a month ago, they emphasized their intention 
that they would not reject any report unless the transaction falls under 
either of the two categories stipulated in the Article 7-61 of the FETR (1. 
option premium more than 20%,  2. illegal  transaction).

Early this week, I talked with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai Oil, and both of 
them confirmed that since Apr. last year total 17 reports (from Hyundai Oil) 
have been filed with the Bank of Korea regarding Oil derivative 
transactions.   All 17 reports were submitted after the transactions had been 
made (ex post facto reporting), and many times Hyundai Oil put 2-3 
transactions together in one package (one-page filled out form per 
transaction) for reporting.   That's why Kim & Chang, the local law firm, got 
the information of 7-8 reports from the Bank of Korea.   

Both Hyundai Oil and the Bank of Korea said that the report is more like a 
notification and that the Bank of Korea just checks whether the transaction 
falls under either of the said 2 categories.  As far as a transaction does 
not fall under either of the 2 categories, neither the Bank of Korea nor 
Hyundai Oil  cares about the reporting.   The Bank of Korea does not insist 
on reviewing the report prior to the transaction and does not care even if 
the report is made even 1 or 2 weeks later.   That's why sometimes it takes a 
week for the Bank of Korea to return the report with its seal on it.   The 
Bank of Korea said that normally it takes less than one hour to review and 
place its seal on a one-page report. 

Regarding the Weather Derivatives, there is an issue whether Weather 
Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial 
Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product.   In the FETR, 
there is a general definition of the ""Derivative Transaction"".   No separate 
definition of the ""Commodity Derivatives"" or ""Financial Derivatives"".    
However, the FETR treats the Derivative Transaction whose underlying products 
are commodity products like grains and metals differently from the Derivative 
Transaction whose underlying products are financial products like interest 
payments and foreign currencies.   For convenience' sake, I would call the 
former the ""Commodity Derivative"" and the latter the ""Financial 
Derivative"".    The FETR stipulates that a prior report to the Bank of Korea 
is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are not 
financial products (i.e., Commodity Derivative by our own definition) and 
that a prior approval of the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative 
Transaction whose underlying assets are financial products (Financial 
Derivative by our definition) ""among non-banking residents or between 
non-banking resident and non-resident"".   No approval or report is required 
for the Financial Derivative Transaction if a banking institution is 
involved.    When I talked to the Int'l Finance Dept. of the Bank of Korea, 
which is responsible for the prior report and approval, they informally 
indicated that the underlying asset of the Weather Derivatives doesn't seem 
to be a financial product.  They said that they would need better 
understanding of the Weather Derivatives in order to determine that formally.

I hope that Matt's note and the above information are useful for all of you 
to understand the legal situation better.  Let's discuss and clarify these 
issues in our conference call.  Thanks.

Regards,
Jae-Moo

Subject: Re: EOL Korea  

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for 
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your and 
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the 
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since 
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim & 
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may 
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on which 
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval, 
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the 
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval is 
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be 
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact 
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals since 
reporting and approval may take several weeks. 

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization 
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party 
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds. 

Regards
Matt

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigating 
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in 
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interest 
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in 
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new 
products (e.g., Seoul weather). 

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the 
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point, 
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To 
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to 
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at the 
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at 
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the 
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me 
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict, 
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated.  

Best regards,

Jae-Moo","Phillip,

"Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

How are you? Thanks for coordinating an offer for me.

As I told Stinson early this week, I understand that
it is a little bit tricky for Enron in term of my
starting date. To be honest, I am very flexible
myself, it really depends on Enron. If you want me to
start right now, then I would expect Enron to
compensate for my this year's bonus. In this case, it
is not quite fair for Enron, since now we are already
at the end of October.

Another option is that we can work out an offer right
now, and I can start my new job right after I get my
bonus from Williams, which should be in the very
beginning of February. This choice is perfectly fine
with me. Actually it might be even a little better for
me since Williams has had very good year this year.

Vince, I just want to tell you that I am very
interested in your group, and very excited about this
opportunity. If you have any questions, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308.

P.S.  On the Heat Rate Spreadsheet, look@ the 2x1 and 1x1 tabs (it is a work 
in progress).

What about the 'operational tools' you referred to that you may have on the 
shelf and can provide to me?


>>> ""Curry, Mike"" <Mike.Curry@ENRON.com> 04/11/01 01:54PM >>>
Frank, here is the list of operational info that I think would be
helpful to our team:

1) Ramp Rates for plant (ramp up and down)
 - zero to 139 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 140 to 230 MW
 - 231 to 280 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 281 to 460 MW

2) Heat Rate Curves
 - vs. output
 - vs. Temp. / Rel. Humidity

3) Start charge (in MMBtu) -  please define each, i.e. cold start means
plant has been down x hours
 - cold start
 - warm start
 - hot start

4) Is there a maximum number of starts per year?

5) Is there any permit limitations other than below?
 - In 1x1 must operate only between 140 MW and 230MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - In 2x1 must operate only between 280 MW and 460MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - Annual limit on run time or tons of emission?
 - What is a violation, is it any deviation or must the deviation
occur for a min. amount of time?

6) Operational limits
 - In 1x1 operates between 140 MW and 230MW approx.
 - In 2x1 operates between 280 MW and 460MW approx.
 - Any other level that can be operated?  Any duct firing?

Thanks for your assistance with these, - Mike

HAAS MBA STUDENTS TAKE TOP HONORS AT MARKETING CASE COMPETITION
A team of five Haas MBA students won top honors this past weekend at the 
2001 Elite Eight Brand Case Challenge at the Carlson School of Management 
at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  Team members Anita Akerkar, 
MBA 03; Dennis Cox, MBA 02; Aman Desouza, MBA 02; Nate Kraft, MBA 02; and 
Sherry Lin, MBA 03 competed against seven top business schools including 
UCLA's Anderson, Carlson, Fuqua, Kelley (Indiana), Kellogg, Michigan, and 
Wharton.

""It was a great experience,"" said Sherry Lin. ""This really solidifies Haas' 
position as a top marketing program.""

The teams received a marketing case on Yoplait's Go-Gurt and were given 36 
hours to prepare a structured analysis and recommendations.  Go-Gurt is a 
$135 million portable yogurt snack brand that targets kids ages 8 to 12. 
After a strong launch, the brand was experiencing a decline in growth and 
increased competition.  The Haas team's suggestion included both deepening 
the relationship with the current target customers and expanding to a new 
market -- teenagers. What made the Haas solution especially appealing was 
the use of focus groups. The team rented a car and traveled to a local mall 
to conduct focus groups with teenagers to find out what would encourage 
them to buy Go-Gurt.

  WIRELESS AT CAL: HAAS CONTINUES TO EXPAND WIRELESS COVERAGE
Wire-free connection has become reality at the Haas School. Wireless access 
services, such as e-mail and the web, are now available in and around 
select areas of the Haas School. The new service is part of UC Berkeley's 
pilot wireless LAN service, known as AirBears, which enables students to 
connect to the campus network if they have a laptop equipped with a 
wireless Ethernet card.

So far at Haas, AirBears wireless LAN coverage is available in: the Wells 
Fargo Room, the Haas courtyard, Jimmie Bean's Caf?, the Bank of America 
Forum, the MBA lounge, the undergraduate lounge, the MFE Collaboration lab, 
library group study rooms, the Bakar Computer Center, C230 sloped floor 
classroom, and F320 classroom. According to Mike Pivonka, the plan is to 
extend coverage to all Haas classrooms and major conference rooms before 
the start of spring semester.

Using the AirBears wireless LAN requires:
    + a laptop or other computer with 802.11b wireless ethernet card (WiFi 
certified).
    + a currently valid CalNetID and passphrase.
    + an SSL-enabled web browser (IE, Netscape etc.) on your computer.
    + an area with AirBears coverage.

AirBears is also available in the Cesar E. Chavez Student Center, the 
Bechtel Engineering Library study area, and the Doe Library study carrels 
(selected areas). It will soon be available in the Mario Savio Free Speech 
Movement Caf?; the Northgate Lecture Hall; and the Foothill Residence Halls 
(selected common areas). Please check http://www.net.berkeley.edu/wireless 
for updates on availability.

THE 24TH ANNUAL REAL ESTATE & ECONOMICS SYMPOSIUM: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE 
HOLD FOR REAL ESTATE?
Predicting the future of the economy and the real estate market in the US 
has always been difficult and has become even more so after the attacks on 
September 11. At Haas this daunting task will be taken on by the Fisher 
Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics (FCREUE) at its annual 
conference, which brings together leading experts from academia, business, 
and government to discuss and offer predictions on the economy and the real 
estate market.

The 24th annual Real Estate and Economics Symposium,  ""Adjusting to the New 
Economic and Real Estate Realities,"" takes place November 19 from 8:00 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.  At this full-day 
program, experts will talk about various aspects of the risks in the real 
estate business and how real estate will adjust to the new economic 
environment.

""The demise of the new economy and ensuing economic recession in the US and 
Silicon Valley, the energy crisis, and the post-September 11th 
uncertainties, have created an unsettled and clearly changing sea-level for 
real estate and other asset markets,"" said Bob Edlestein, symposium 
co-chairman and real estate development professor.  ""It appears in the 
short run that real estate is in troubled waters with its outcome depending 
upon how quickly we can stabilize the general economy.  It is likely that 
there's 'worse' ahead before things turn better in the real estate market; 
but, ten years from now, it is likely that our economy will be faring 
better and real estate will be a hot asset again.""

An array of experts will speak about the changing social-political-economic 
environment and its impact on real estate.
    +Kenneth Rosen, the California State Professor of Real Estate and Urban 
Economics and chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban 
Economics, will give his annual real estate forecast.
    +Bob Parry, president of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco, will 
explain how the economy and policy are likely to fare in the near future.
    +Michael Nacht, dean of the Richard & Rhoda Goldman School of Public 
Policy and former assistant director for strategic and Eurasian affairs of 
the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, will provide a political 
backdrop about security issues and their likely effects upon the US economy.

The complete agenda and additional details can be found on the FCREUE 
website www.haas.berkeley.edu/realestate.

All Haas faculty are invited to attend the symposium free of charge. 
Complimentary attendance is also available for students who volunteer to 
help out during the Symposium.  Contact Zee Zeleski at 
zeleski@haas.berkeley.edu to register.

HAAS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SHINE AT CASE COMPETITIONS
The undergraduate team representing Haas at the 2001 University of Texas 
International Business Challenge Case Competition in Austin, Texas, brought 
home both second place and the competition's Professional Excellence Award.

The International Business Challenge is an annual undergraduate business 
case competition held each fall at the University of Texas at Austin. Teams 
come from 20 leading undergraduate business schools from the US, Canada, 
South America, Asia, and Europe. The first place team was from the 
University of Hong Kong.

The teams were given a case depicting real-world problems confronted by 
Dell Computer Corporation and three days to prepare a solution. The teams 
presented their solution to the ""client,"" a panel of distinguished judges 
from Dell, Solomon Smith Barney, and other members of the business 
community.  Four teams were selected to advance to the final round.

""The Haas Team approached this case as a real client case and spent time 
analyzing the current market and how Dell could achieve a higher revenue 
growth,"" says Annie Lai, director of admissions and operations in the 
Undergraduate Program.  ""They not only presented a great recommendation, 
but also demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of global business 
issues.""

The Haas team included Eurie Kim, BS 01; Parizad Olver, BS 01; Megan 
Schofield, BS 01; and Julie Wang, BS 02. The faculty/staff advisors to the 
team were George Cluff, Steve Etter, David Robinson, and Annie Lai. Haas is 
the first program ever to earn awards at four consecutive University of 
Texas International Business Challenge Case Competitions.  In addition, 
case competition teams from the Haas Undergraduate Program have won awards 
in 7 of the 9 international case competitions they have entered since fall 
1998.

Investment Banking Case Competition
Back at home, the Fourth Annual Investment Banking Case Competition 
presented by the Haas School of Business and Goldman Sachs & Co. took place 
on October 30, 2001. Each year this event showcases one of Goldman Sachs' 
recent high profile transactions. This year's case focused on the recent 
sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.  The winning team included 
Joseph Spector, BS 02; Annabelle Louie, BS December 01 (business 
administration and mass communications); Peter Lee, BS 02 (math); and Tina 
Tong, BS December 01, (business administration and economics).

HAAS DOES WELL IN OFF-BEAT RANKINGS
As business school rankings proliferate, they highlight different strengths 
of MBA programs. In October, Haas was ranked well in three rankings: Beyond 
Grey Pinstripes' survey on social and environmental stewardship, Computer 
World's Techno MBA survey, and America Economia magazine's survey on global 
MBA programs.

Beyond Grey Pinstripes
The Haas School was ranked among the top 15% of business schools in the 
Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey released on Oct. 31. The survey was conducted 
jointly by the World Resources Institute and The Aspen Institute for Social 
Innovation Through Business in an effort to determine how well business 
schools teach their MBA students how to manage the social and environmental 
impact of business.

The top five schools at the cutting edge of social impact management were 
those at Harvard, Loyola Marymount, Michigan - Ann Arbor, North Carolina, 
and York University (Canada). George Washington University, University of 
Jyvaeskylae (Finland), Michigan, North Carolina, and Yale were listed as 
the top five at the cutting edge of environmental impact management.

The Haas School was listed in the second tier of ten schools having 
significant activities in the areas of social and environmental impact 
management. The survey specifically mentioned Haas for its Social Venture 
Competition, its participation in the Corporate Environmental Management 
concentration (offered by nine UC campuses), and for having an endowed 
professorship in the area of sustainable enterprise or sustainable management.

The survey weighed student coursework (50%), institutional support (30%), 
and faculty research (20%) to determine its top 15% of graduate business 
schools teaching social and environmental responsibility. Of the 463 
schools that received the extensive questionnaire, 122 schools responded.

The Techno MBA
Computer World magazine listed the Haas School among the top 25 
technology-driven business schools in its 2001 Techno MBA survey published 
on Oct. 22. The purpose of the survey, according to the magazine, was to 
determine ""which schools do the best job of combining good management 
techniques and technology innovation under the general heading of sound 
business practices.""

In its two-part survey, Computer World asked recruiters to nominate the 
best techno-MBA programs nationally based on their recruiting experiences 
at these schools. Computer World then asked MBA programs to nominate what 
they considered to be the best technology-driven programs (other than their 
own) and to submit information on their own programs and students.

The University of California was represented in the top 25 with three 
campuses - Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine. Other top-ranked schools 
included Wharton, Indiana, Northwestern, Michigan, North Carolina, and UT 
Austin. Computer World did not assign individual rankings to these top 25 
schools.

According to Computer World, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Harvard, Duke, Stanford, 
and New York University were also nominated as top programs, but did not 
participate in the survey.

America Economia
The Latin American business journal America Economia ranked the Haas School 
#11 among global MBA programs offered in the US and Europe in its Sept. 13 
issue.

The top universities offering global MBAs were:
1. Harvard University
2. U. Pennsylvania (Wharton)
3. Stanford University
4. MIT (Sloan)
5. Northwestern (Kellogg)
6. INSEAD (tied)
6. London Business School (tied)
7. University of Chicago
8. Columbia University
9. UCLA (Anderson)
10. University of Texas-Austin
11. UC Berkeley (Haas)
12. Duke University (Fuqua)
13. New York University (Stern)
14. University of Michigan
15. University of Virginia (Darden)

The rankings issue of America Economia examined the competition US and 
European business schools pose to Latin American institutions. In addition 
to its global MBA ranking, it ranked Latin American business schools in a 
separate ranking.

SOCIAL VENTURE COMPETITION EXPANDS INTO NEW NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP
The Haas School of Business and Columbia Business School have formed a 
joint partnership with The Goldman Sachs Foundation to expand the Haas 
Social Venture Competition into the National Social Venture Competition. 
The competition invites aspiring entrepreneurs to develop plans for 
businesses that have a clear, quantifiable social return as well as a 
healthy financial bottom line.

The National Social Venture Competition originated in 1999 as a 
student-organized social venture competition at the Haas School of 
Business. In the past few years, the competition has attracted more than 
100 teams from business schools across the United States and Europe.  The 
new partnership with Columbia Business School and The Goldman Sachs 
Foundation will expand the competition's reach and scale.

The Goldman Sachs Foundation will underwrite the competition with a gift of 
$1.5 million to help build a national platform for social entrepreneurship. 
""This innovative program is an important milestone in the social enterprise 
field and presents a unique opportunity to advocate high quality 
entrepreneurship education on a national scale,"" said Stephanie Bell-Rose, 
president of The Goldman Sachs Foundation.  ""The program underscores the 
Foundation's mission of supporting educational excellence by encouraging 
outstanding students to develop the tools that help them become the global 
leaders of tomorrow.""

""The National Social Venture Competition reflects the growing commitment of 
business leaders and entrepreneurs to foster profitable activities that 
address major social challenges, such as protecting the environment, 
preventing disease, and improving educational outcomes,"" said Laura Tyson, 
dean of the Haas School of Business. ""Haas MBA students have done an 
outstanding job in launching a business plan competition to promote 
socially responsible business ventures. Our new partnership with Columbia 
University's business school and The Goldman Sachs Foundation will increase 
public awareness of these issues and encourage business students to employ 
the tools of business to create positive social change.""

Throughout the year, the entrepreneurship centers of the two business 
schools will coordinate with The Goldman Sachs Foundation to organize and 
promote national events in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.  The 
Eugene M. Lang Center for Entrepreneurship at Columbia Business School will 
host an inaugural symposium on October 5 in New York City.  The symposium 
will feature a public dialogue with leaders in the social entrepreneurship 
arena to explore the growing demand and marketplace expectations for social 
ventures.

Throughout the year, both schools will host additional events to encourage 
participation and evaluate submissions. Mentoring workshops will take place 
at Columbia Business School and the Haas School with prominent investors 
and alumni helping teams to perfect their business plans and presentations. 
The teams' executive summaries are due on January 18, 2002.

The 2001/2002 national competition finals, hosted by the Haas School's 
Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, will take place at UC 
Berkeley on April 5-6, 2002.

""This unique and powerful partnership reflects Columbia's commitment to 
supporting entrepreneurship as a vehicle for social change,"" remarked Meyer 
Feldberg, dean of Columbia Business School.  ""Tomorrow's business leaders 
must grasp more than convention; they must also be prepared to develop and 
steer businesses of all sizes and types through a global economy that 
demands consideration not only of profit and shareholder value, but also of 
broader human interests.""

Teams in this year's competition can look to past participants in the Haas 
Social Venture Competition for inspiration in launching social 
ventures.  Previous participants who have gone on to establish businesses 
include:

+ Sea Power & Associates (www.seapower.cc), winner of the 2001 Haas Social 
Venture Competition, harnesses ocean wave power to produce electricity for 
coastal communities in the Pacific.

+Aprotea (www.aprotea.com) makes biochips to enhance drug discovery and won 
a prize for best management team in 2001.

+Prisma Microfinance (www.prismamicrofinance.com) provides investor-funded 
micro-loans in developing countries and won a prize for the best analysis 
of its social return on investment.

+Ripple Effects (www.rippleeffects.com), a winner of the 2000 competition, 
has already won nine major national product awards for its learning software.

BLUE MARTINI CEO ZWEBEN TO GIVE KEYNOTE AT 2001 KNOWLEDGE FORUM
The fifth annual UC Berkeley Forum on Knowledge and the Firm will explore 
""New Patterns of Management in the Knowledge Economy"" in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium on September 21. Leading thinkers and practitioners in 
the field of knowledge management will discuss the new patterns of 
management that are emerging as companies experiment and adapt different 
ways to beat their competition.

The Knowledge Forum is organized annually by the Institute of Management, 
Organization, and Innovation (IMIO) at the Haas School. This event is open 
to faculty, students, staff, alumni, and members of the public. The 
registration fee will be waived for faculty and UC Berkeley students. 
Students need to register by September 14.

The keynote address will be given by Monte Zweben, chairman, president, and 
CEO of Blue Martini Software, which helps companies understand, target, and 
interact with their customers and business partners. Prior to founding Blue

MICHAEL KATZ TO SERVE AS DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ECONOMIC 
ANALYSIS
Michael Katz, the Edward J. and Mollie Arnold Professor of Business 
Administration, has been appointed the deputy assistant attorney general 
for economic analysis in the Antitrust Division of the Department of 
Justice. As deputy assistant attorney general, Katz will supervise all 
economic analysis within the Antitrust Division and direct the division's 
Economic Analysis Group.

""Like the stereotypical economist, I look at Michael's appointment from two 
perspectives,"" says Ben Hermalin, associate dean of academic affairs. ""On 
the one hand, I can't think of a Haas faculty member who'd be harder to 
lose for a year or two than Michael. On the other hand, I can't think of an 
economist I'd trust more to advise the nation on antitrust matters than 
Michael. I just hope the current administration has sufficient sense to 
listen to Michael and take his advice seriously.""

Since 1987, Katz has served as a professor at the Haas School of 
Business.  In addition to researching on competitive strategy in systems 
markets, vertical integration, cooperative research and development, and 
antitrust in high-tech industries, he also directs the school's Center for 
Telecommunications and Digital Convergence. In 1989 and 1993, he was 
awarded the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award.

 From 1994 to 1996, Katz served as Chief Economist at the Federal 
Communications Commission, where he was responsible for integrating 
economic analysis into all aspects of Commission policy making. He 
formulated and implemented regulatory policies for all industries under the 
FCC's jurisdiction, including cable and broadcast television and local, 
long distance, and wireless telephony. In 1996 he was recognized with the 
FCC chairman's Special Achievement Award for his excellence in service at 
the commission.

He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1978, where he was 
awarded a prize as the top graduate in economics. He received his Ph.D. 
from Oxford University in 1982. A frequent lecturer and author of numerous 
articles on antitrust and consumer issues, Katz is also co-editor of the 
California Management Review and the Journal of Economics and Management 
Strategy.

""Michael Katz is a leading scholar with extensive experience in issues 
important to the Antitrust Division,"" said Charles A. James, assistant 
attorney general for antitrust. ""His keen insight will be of great 
advantage to the department as we work to protect competition in today's 
global economy. We are privileged to have him join us.""

Carl Shapiro, the Transamerica Professor of Business Strategy and director 
of the Institute of Business and Economics Research (IBER), was the deputy 
assistant attorney general for Economics in the Antitrust Division from 
1995 to 1996.

LEADING EDGE: THE FUTURE COMES TO HAAS
This year's Leading Edge Conference, titled ""@ the intersection of 
business, technology, and leadership,"" will bring heavy hitters from the 
business and technology sectors to Haas to discuss the future of their 
industry. Scheduled for September 21 and 22, the Leading Edge Conference 
has traditionally been one of the largest of the student-run conferences at 
Haas.

This year the conference will have 15 panel discussions with over 70 of the 
most influential minds in technology and business today, the EdgeXpo 
technology fair, and the opportunity to network and drop resumes with some 
of the top technology firms in the industry who will be making special 
appearances on campus for this event only.

As part of the keynote schedule this year, the organizers are debuting the 
Edge Futurists' Forum -- a keynote discussion session about the future of 
technology between industry innovators from Sun Microsystems, Xerox Parc, 
and the Institute for the Future.  This event includes distinguished 
visionaries such as John Gage, chief science officer of Sun Microsystems, 
and will be hosted by Business 2.0 President Ned Desmond. Brian Bogosian, 
president and CEO of Visto Corporation, will be the closing keynote speaker 
on Saturday evening.

THE FIRST OF SIX NEW FACULTY PROFILES: TERRENCE HENDERSHOTT JOINS THE 
MANUFACTURING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GROUP
Terrence Hendershott has joined the Haas faculty as an assistant professor 
of manufacturing and information technology.

Hendershott researches the information technology behind electronic stock 
markets. His previous position was as the Xerox Assistant Professor of 
Computers & Information Systems at the William E. Simon School of Business 
Administration at the University of Rochester.

Hendershott earned his bachelors in mathematics and statistics at Miami 
University. He spent several years in industry, first as a senior analyst 
at Andersen Consulting then as an associate at Cornerstone Research. He 
went on to earn his Ph.D. in operations, information, and technology at the 
Graduate School of Business at Stanford University in 1999.

In his dissertation at Stanford, Hendershott created a theoretical model of 
how electronic trading systems compete with stock exchanges. The largest 
electronic trading systems are electronic communications networks (ECNs), 
which are used for 30 to 40% of NASDAQ trades each day.

Hendershott is now looking at the impact that ECNs have had on stock 
trading. This includes the expansion of trading outside the normal trading 
day, the cost of trading using ECNs, and how the use of ECNs affects price 
discovery. ""While the use of ECNs has grown dramatically since the mid-90s, 
unless there is some structural change in trading behavior, I don't think 
we will see 24-hour trading anytime soon,"" says Hendershott.

As a sideline to this work, Hendershott collaborates with his father, 
Patric, who is a professor of property economics and finance at the 
University of Aberdeen in Scotland, and his brother, Robert, who is an 
associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University. ""The papers we 
wrote combined our interests in how the Internet is affecting the economy 
by examining real estate (malls in particular),"" says Hendershott. ""I 
expect I will continue to do some of these because they are fun and an 
excuse to interact with my father and brother more.""

Hendershott will teach an information technology strategy course during the 
Spring 2002 semester. His office is in F596, his phone number is 643-0619, 
and his e-mail address is hender@haas.berkeley.edu.

DIANE DIMEFF HEADS FOR COLORADO AS ASSISTANT DEAN FOR MBA PROGRAMS AT CU 
BOULDER
After serving for 8 years as director of the Haas School's Evening MBA 
Program, Diane Dimeff has accepted a position at the University of Colorado 
at Boulder as the assistant dean for MBA Programs. She will be leaving Haas 
on Friday, September 28.

""I'm very excited about the opportunity to help build and grow CU Boulder's 
MBA Programs, especially since Colorado has been a vacation destination for 
my family for so many years,"" says Dimeff. ""It will be hard to leave Haas 
and UC Berkeley as I've been associated with the university for 30 years 
now, either as a student or as an employee.  I'm very appreciative of the 
opportunity I've had to participate in the evolution of the Haas Evening 
MBA Program and thank the faculty, staff, students, alumni, and the 
administration for their support.""

Under Dimeff's direction, the Evening MBA Program has grown from a San 
Francisco satellite to a thriving on-campus program. Her major accomplishments:

- applications to the Evening MBA Program increased by 128%, and enrollment 
increased by 58%
- the average GMAT increased from 652 to 680
-  the Evening MBA Program moved from San Francisco to the UCB campus
- the core curriculum was reconfigured
- the number of electives offered tripled
- the comprehensive examination was replaced by the the mid-program 
academic retreat
- the International Business Seminar was initiated

""We wish Diane great success at the University of Colorado, Boulder -- 
despite her new school having as a mascot a shaggy, plodding, female 
buffalo named Ralphie instead of a sophisticated, nimble bear named Oski!"" 
says Andrew Shogan, associate dean of instruction.

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful!=20


Hi All -=20

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the=20
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This on=
e,=20
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my=
=20
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.=20

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago.=
=20
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably=
=20
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.=20

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished=
=20
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like=
=20
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any=20
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As=20
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since=
=20
turned over the letter.=20

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came=
=20
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.=20

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being=20
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second=
=20
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information=
=20
that I did.=20
